Mona had gone to visit Taj Mahal in <Agra> with her friend Lucky
What can I tell you, apart from <Taj Mahal>, she has visited <Red Fort>, <Mehtab Bagh> and many other places
In November <Neelam Madam> organized a Seminar which was very important to attend
I, <Mona>, <Lucky> were also the part of anchoring of that Seminar
Seminar was organized at <Kanhaiya Lal Institute> of <Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar University>, <Agra>
<Neelam> Madam had no idea that this Seminar could be so big and International
Scholars and <Professors> from many leading Universities participated in the Seminar
An expert of Sanskrit language <Dr. Abhimanyu> from our <Kashi Hindu University> also went there
Well, one more thing happened that at the time of departure we did not have confirm ticket
Firstly <Mona> and <Lucky> said that we are going to sit in A.C berth, so we sat in A.C without ticket
The seat on which we were sitting belonged to a <Bihari> man, as soon as he arrived he started fighting
Now Lucky's mind turned so frustrated that the fight had happened
<Mona>, <Lucky> and I ran away to the other coach of the Train without further discussion
Do you think that we got seat?
Hey life is not so easy, one has to struggle at every step in life
Our journey had just begun, and the Train was also honking its horn to leave
We could not understand what to do and where should we go?
Actually at that time the holidays of <Chhath> were over
All working people and laborers were returning to their residence
By now you must have guessed who were the maximum number of people boarding in the Train
You are guessing right, it was mostly <Bihari> people who were there
Some people ask us to go and sit in the sleeper, while others ask us to wait for the T.T
<Mona> told us to go in sleeper first, maybe we can get a seat
We went through the Kitchen compartment of the Train to the sleeper
O Lord there was no place for us to set our feet, how could we fit there?
<Mona> and <Lucky> then ran away from there too
We had no choice now, neither here nor there
We couldn't understand anything so we sat quietly near the same door
Now stop it, there is no need to lie so much, we all know
After some time T.T also arrived and everyone's heart started beating twice as fast
We thought that he might file a <fine> on us
Even if we had been fined we would not have had the cash money
Then T.T Uncle asked us, why are you sitting here?
So <Mona> said we don't have a ticket, we have to get our ticket made
T.T Uncle said no, you all go from here to the sleeper compartment
Now we had no choice left apart from going to the sleeper compartment

Dad was telling me today that I have to go to my Uncle's house but I don't feel like going there
I promised myself that from tomorrow I would go to library every day
I will study well this time and pass this exam
I want coaching for <T.G.T> exam, please tell me about some good coaching
I have not paid for Sentence Composition, all the sentence composers are harassing me by saying so
<Aditya> was saying that he wants question bank book of Science subject of class Tenth
I want to buy a <Jacket>, for how much can I get it ?
Today in the morning my Father and Mother had gone to take bath in <Ganga> and they brought <Jalebi> with jaggery for me
I like jaggery <Jalebi> so give it to me too
Today and tomorrow there is a medical fair in my Village, I will go to get my <eyes> checked
What do I need to take with me to get tested at <Medical Fair>?
I don't know yet what all I will have to carry with me, but will carry Aadhar Card and what else?
What is the timing of exam today?  You didn't tell me, your Mother was also asking
I have a lot to read today, you go, I will not come
Why are you asking my Grandfather's name, why should I tell you my Grandfather's name?
About five six years ago,I went to <Vaishnodevi Temple> I had a lot of fun there
I am also going to <Vaishnodevi Temple> with my Parents, got it
Every day I go to College on my Bicycle, I have to work very hard to ride the Bicycle
Whenever I take Tiffin to <College>, all my friends eat all my food
I have to go to <Lanka> today to have Tea with my friends
I am also going to have a Cold Coffee at <V.T>, if you want to go then let me know
Okay, I'll go too and have Cold Coffee, but I don't have any money
I study and work very well in my Library
I go home every day at five in the evening, you call me at six in the evening, okay
There is no money in my phone, I will not be able to call you, you do it yourself
Today I bought a book online but found the book torn
Everyone scolds me every day that why do I keep sleeping for so long?
I want to buy a mobile stand for studying
We have a very nice mobile stand in our shop, you can take it
What is the need to get mobile stand, it is of no use
Can I see your mobile, it looks very nice, how much is it?
My mobile is very old and I got it for twelve hundred rupees at that time
I have got a very good book of <Gandhiji> today, should I show you?
Today my Uncle is coming home so I will not come to College today
This morning, my Mother asked me to make Carrot pudding
I told my Mother that I need <milk> and khoya to make Carrot pudding
You know what my <Mother> said, she said that she will bring milk and we will make it with the <raw burfis> that brother in law has brought
I also thought that it is okay, this will finish the barfi and carrot will also not get spoiled
But what can I tell you, there was so much work in the morning that neither Mother could bring milk nor I could make pudding
I just came to College after boiled carrots
Now when my Mother will be free from work, she will bring milk and make pudding herself
I love Carrot Pudding and I also love Peanut Pudding
Now when I go to home in the evening, I will eat pudding
Today is <Friday>, let's see what dishes we cook for dinner today
Yesterday <Palak Paneer> was prepared in such a way that I went crazy after eating it
It seemed as if nothing had been added into it
But what can I say, good spices like garlic, onion, tomato and chilli are also grinded and added to it
Father had brought very good Spinach from <Raja talab> but if it was kept soaked in water, it would not dry
When I went to prepare curry this evening, I saw that the <Spinach> had dried up
After a lot of sorting, hundred grams of it came out clean and curry was prepared from it
Now I think that because of less <Spinach>, a good curry may not have been made
Let's see, which vegetable will I make today, but whatever I make it will be good only
I am thinking of making pea puri and cabbage curry this evening, <Ajay> Bro will also eat it
And today <Ajay> bro's friends are also coming and perhaps they all will also stay in the evening
If they also stays then <Puri> will hardly be made because then too much quantity will have to be made
Let's see, if the centering work be done in the house by tomorrow or will it take two three more days
It would have been better if the work was done, because of that many other works have halt
Because of this, Father is not able to even go to the field to play <Football>
His National Level <Football Match> is going to start from the fourteenth of the month
Earlier <Father> was not willing to participate in this but after repeated insistence he agreed
<Sultan> Uncle was also very worried For my father that he should also play this match
My <Father> had thought only about my Uncle and his Parents all his life and now he thinks about me
I told him that now if <Football> is your passion then at least you can play it now, there is still time
After hearing all these things and after my insistence, he agreed to pay his fees
And look, meanwhile Father is busy with home duties and can't even go to practice
Mother is worried that he might get wound while playing
Nowadays there is a bustle in the city also because a conference is going to be held in our <Banaras>
The name of the conference is <G Twenty> which is probably being organized for the first time in India
Now think how much <Banaras> has benefited after Modi ji's arrival
All the roads are also being widened at an amazing pace and there has been a lot of improvement in <Banaras> in terms of cleanliness
Now there is a lot of awareness in the minds of people about cleanliness
After the arrival of <Modi ji>, the name of Banaras has become famous all over the Country and abroad
<Modi> <Yogi> has given a new identity to Banaras
When the corridor of <Kashi Vishwanath> was built, everyone was stunned to see it
Because before this no one would have even thought that the people who used to go for darshan from the streets will now go straight to the <Temple> after taking bath
Firstly go to <Dashwaswamedh> and take a good bath in <Ganga> and then roam around in the corridor and have darshan
Now there is facility for everything from traveling in <boat> to crossing
You know that there are more than eighty four ghats in <Banaras> and you can visit them by spending just a hundred rupees
Once walking and talking me <Mona> <Juhi> and <Lucky>  are coming on foot from <Dasaswamedh>
There are so many things to see that you won't know how path will finished
While leaving we went by <boat> and while coming back we came on foot till <Assi Ghat>
What's there to do, we just have to talk, what else?
On the other side of <Ganga> the work of Tent city was going on very fast
And I have heard that its work is in the final stage
As soon as the work of Tent city is finished, market will start bustling
I had heard that tourists will get all kinds of facilities in Tent City
The rent for a one day room in <Ganga Tent City> is ten thousand rupees
I had heard that people can also book for weddings
Yes, there will be much expenditure in marriage and the sorrounding crowd will also rise
Anyway, no poor man could get married in the <Tent city>, only millionaires and billionaires can get married
All kinds of facilities will be available in <Ganga Tent City> starting from meeting rooms
Yesterday Vice Chancellor of <Meerut University> attended a workshop at <B.H.U> as a Chief Guest
Vice Chancellor said that most of the students of <Uttar Pradesh> are wasting their time behind competitive examinations
I also think it is right that students should make a goal for themselves and work hard towards that goal
Former Vice Chancellor of <Chaudhary Charan Singh University> <Prof. Narendra Kumar Taneja> was invited as the keynote speaker of Agricultural Sciences
<Professor Saheb> was saying that about eighty percent of the youth are running just after the jobs
And this figure includes more children from <East> part of <Uttar Pradesh>
And in the same workshop <Professor Punjab Singh> also participated and he said that there are a lot of opportunities in Uttar Pradesh at this time
I heard from my dad today that after <Vande Bharat Express>, now <Vande Metro Train> will run in our <Banaras>
As <D.E.M.U> will be operational, <Vande Metro> will soon become operational for short distances in the coming days
For example, <Vande Metro> will be operated from <Banaras Cantt> to <P.D.D.U Nagar Railway Station>, <Varanasi> <Pratapgarh> and <Varanasi> <Prayagraj> Railway Station
I have heard that for the convenience of the people, <Vande Metro> will have A.C, sleeper as well as unreserved coaches
<Telivision> showcase that soon <Hydrogen Train> would also be seen on the Railway tracks
Railway Minister <Ashwini Vaishnav> had shared information with the Railway Officer about this provision in the budget
<D.R.M Ramashray Pandey> of North Eastern Railway of <Varanasi> Division said that this time a provision for <Hydrogen Train> has been made in the budget
In the budget two trains have been included in the ambitious plan by <Railway Minister>
According to Railway Officials, many decisions have been taken in the <Railway Budget>
We have also heard that it will be smaller than <Vande Metro Train> and will run between two cities
This will provide immense benefits and convenience to people traveling between the two cities on a daily basis
Listen Sister, there is good news for <Manduwadih> and <Nakkhighat> residentials
Now for the convenience of the people the government will build underpasses at <Manduwadih Railway Crossing> and <Nakkighat Railway Crossing>
This underpass can ease the movement of people
You are aware that after the construction of <Manduwadih> flyover, <Manduwadih> Railway Crossing was closed by the Railways
The closing of the gate caused a lot of trouble to the traders and nearby residents
On the evening of February four our Chief Minister <Yogi Adityanath> is coming on a two day visit, on the day of Ravidas Jayanti
On February Five, he is coming to the Temple of Sirgovardhan to attend the birth anniversary of <Saint Ravidas>
You remember the statement of <Ravidas ji> that if the mind is healed then Ganga will be saved in trouble
When I went to <camp>, preparations for the birth anniversary of <Shri Guru Ravidasji> were being finalized
The birth place of <Sant Ravidas Maharaj> is <Sirgovdharanpur> in <Banaras>
Service mens are arriving very fast at the birthplace located in <Sirgovardhan>
Every year on <Ravidas Jayanti> people from all over the country and mostly from <Punjab> come to <Sargovardhan>
<Yogi ji> after darshan and worshipping here, will also taste the langar distributed in the Temple
I heard that after visiting the Temple, the Chief Minister will review the preparations for <G Twenty>
Because for the first time the <G Twenty> conference is being held in our Banaras
People who took stock of the development works of <Banaras> have also stopped at some places to know the reality
The crowd in the <Seer> fair area has increased a lot and the shops selling toys, clothes, books and many other things have opened
When I was coming in the morning I saw a long queue from <Ravidas Temple> to the langar hall
Heart filled with joy after watching the final match of Indian Under Nineteen Women's Cricket on <Telivision>
<Indian Team> played a great match and gave a great defeat to <England>
<Under Nineteen> Cricket was organized for the first time in India and <India> won the award in first time only
Do you know that today <Indian team> has brought a prize for <India> from <South Africa>?
<Indian Women's Team> created history by defeating <England> Women's team by a total of seven wickets in their last match of the World Cup
Today, between the <Gyanvapi> case and the hearing in the court, <Shringar Gauri> Maa was worshiped as per the rituals
Today here General Secretary of All India Sant Committee <Dandi Swami Jitendranand Saraswati> performed the traditional worship of <Shringar Gauri Maa> located at <Gyanvapi Complex>
This worship of <Shringar Gauri Mai> is done every year on the Saptami of Magh month
Ritual worship is performed every year in the month of Magh in the Temple of <Shringar Gauri Mai> in <Kashi Vishwanath Temple>
How it has been cloudy since this morning, it seems that the sunlight will not come out today
By the way, I read in the Newspaper that there is no possibility of rain in <Banaras> for the next ten days
And this is not the rainy season, that's why it will not rain
If even a little rain falls, it is very beneficial for the wheat crop
But if it rains too much the wheat will fall and the crop will fail
You know the weather of <Banaras> is very different from everywhere else
<Banaras> is very hot in summer and very cold in winter
It is so cold in winter that even <Kashmir> fails
And if you come to <Banaras> in summer, you will feel as if you have come in a ball of fire
Now pollution has increased so much in the Country that no place is spared from it
Due to pollution it becomes impossible to predict when the temperature is rising or falling
Due to this pollution the wheat got spoiled last time and there was a lot of loss
Meteorologists believe that the weather will be fine in <February>
There are also chances of light rain in <February>
Today I saw on my mobile that <Siddharth Malhotra> and <Kiara Advani> are getting married
I saw <Siddharth Malhotra> for the first time in the Student of the Year movie
Both <Simple> and I didn't enjoy watching the movie that much
Anyway, I don't like watching movie much, watching a movie means wasting time and money
It's great that <Siddharth> and <Kiara> are getting married
Well I also liked this pair
Yesterday when Father was talking to <Ajay> Brother and <Ajay> Brother was asking him to make Pav Bhaji
<Ajay> Brother always wants to eat Pav Bhaji, anyway he is very fond of eating it
Today in the evening on my way to home I will buy <Pav Bread> from the market
Today I will prepare <Pav Bhaji> and feed him, he will definitely remember
Oh yes, I have to buy spices and some Vegetables for the Bhaji
You know I don't have cash, so how will I buy goods now?
The old lady at the gate doesn't even take money online
Either I have to borrow from her or I have to go to <Gomati Market>
Fine let's see and I have to go to market to get some spices
Truly speaking I don't like going to the market
But whenever I go to <Ghughulpur Market>, I definitely eat chaat golgappa at <Anil> brother's shop
My mouth starts waterering thinking about <Anil> bro's shop
Paneer chaat of <Anil> bro shop is very tasty
<Anil> Bro, even makes sweet golgappas so tasty that you won't feel satisfied without eating them
My father has forbidden me to eat chaat, <golgappa>
Anyway, I don't eat <Golgappa> from every place, I only eat from two places
One is from <Anil> bro's place and the other is from my College bro's place
Wow, College bro makes golgappas even tastier than Anil bro
When I got admission at <V.K.M> College, I ate Golgappa there for the first time
I really enjoyed eating for the first time
Since then, whenever I go on the <Rath Yatra> route, I stop there and definitely eat Golgappa
<Anil> Bro's house is next to my house, before the Railway Gate
Earlier his <Father> used to run this shop, but after his death it is his brother who runs the shop
Yesterday I came to know that the Ph.D form of <Lucknow> has arrived
One of my seniors told me about this on phone itself
I am also thinking of filling this form but there are only two seats for <Linguistics>
O God, have some mercy on me so that I get admission in <Lucknow University>
Last time also I had filled the form of <Lucknow University> but did not know how many marks I got
This time I believe that by the grace of <Kanha> I will got admission
This time I will study very carefully and will get admission
My <N.E.T> exam is about to happen and I have to prepare for this too
Sometimes I wonder whether I have done something wrong by studying <Linguistics>?
Because even if you get sixty percent in <Linguistics> in NET, you do not get qualified
If I had studied any other subject, I would probably have completed my Ph.D by now
But what to do now, if I have studied <Linguistics> then I will study it diligently and will definitely get J.R.F
I think I need to spend more time on my studies
In Two Thousand Twenty Three, I will study very hard and get admission into <Ph.D>
I wish I had studied <Physical Education> along with my studies
I was more interested in <Linguistics> but less in <Physical Education>
Earlier, when I was young my Father used to send me to play <Football> at <D.L.W>
At that time I had also acquired many skills of <Football>
When I was young, I also joined <Football> camps for two or three years
Both my <father> and I were very interested in sports from the beginning
But what can I tell you, my younger Uncle provoked my Father so much that he stopped me from going to the ground
If I had remained consistent in sports, I would have been different today
In sixth grade, I was again admitted to <C.H.S> School and my Father became more relaxed for me
I have prepared very hard in <Khojwa> to get admission in <C.H.S>
But I think you should be careful if you ever send your kids to a big <School>
No matter what happens, it is said that whatever is happening is happening for the good, so maybe all this is good for us
Not everything is written well in everyone's life and not everything is so easy
Okay, tell me which movie have you seen?
I haven't seen a lot of movies but I like the ones I've seen
I found <Umraojan> movie to be a very good movie based on <Banarasi> music family environment
After that  I liked <Chak De India> a lot and it is also my favorite movie
I mostly like old movies because their stories are so accurate
Nowadays after watching movie neither will you understand the story nor will you understand the song
I don't know what people like in today's movies
It is said that film and literature are the mirror of society, but look at today's times
Now the condition of the movie is such that it is only working to spoil society
Nowadays boys and girls learn everything from movies and social media only
Everyone you see is busy taking selfies and making videos
Hey, everyone has to send photos and videos to <Facebook> and <Instagram>
I just don't understand what people get by making these reels?
Everyone is worried here to get hit on social media
But a man himself cannot estimate how much of his time he is wasting on social media
Would I lied to you, I even tried making a video a couple of times
It took so long to make a video that just don't ask
Since then, I've learned that there's not much time to waste
Once you start making video or watching reels, your hours are wasted
Therefore, I would advise you not to fall into the trap of photo and video
By the way, it is said that one should not give advice without asking
Among those who have a lot of talent, only a few people's videos become hit
Either you will be very lucky only then you will be successful on social media
Otherwise, you will waste both your time and mind just getting confused about photo and video
Hey man, I don't know why my head has so much pain today
From the moment I woke up in the morning, It felt as if my skull was about to fall out
Due to poor health, I even went to sleep early yesterday
I thought maybe looking at the screen for too long was causing headache
If I sleep a little more, the pain will reduce but it turned out to be the opposite
Now I feel like the more I sleep, the more I yawn
Anyway, a man should only sleep eight hours
If you sleep for more than eight hours then you are no less than a patient
Eight hours of sleep is enough for us to avoid diseases
Come on, I have to go home a little early today because work is also going on at home
While leaving I also have to go to <market> and buy some vegetables and other items
My mind went crazy this morning
I had to get up at five o'clock this morning, do you know why?
Because I had to get up in the morning and make Pav Bhaji for everyone
Today, I got free after doing puja till six thirty and then started making breakfast
Yesterday  while coming I forgot to buy Pav Bhaji Masala
Even I forgot to buy the main thing that is Bread loaf
When I was returning from here in the evening I was getting a packet of forty rupees
Brother, who will eat such an expensive <Bread loaf>? better man will buy a kilogram of flour for forty rupees
By grinding one kilogram of flour a man will be able to make chapaties and eat it for many days
I did not buy <Pav loaf> because it was so expensive, I thought I would buy it from Mahua's agency only
I had in my mind that if I buy it from the agency, I will get it at a slightly lower price
But when I reached that shop it was closed
Firstly, I didn't have any money to look in any other shop
Yesterday when I left I had to borrow vegetables , if I don't have money so what can I do?
It's good that <Shivani> gave me butter otherwise it would have been turned out a bad <Pav Bhaji>
Yesterday evening itself I had chopped carrots, potatoes, capsicum and all the vegetables
Because I already knew that I would be late no matter how early I woke up in the morning
After waking up in the morning, taking bath and doing puja, I went to the shop and bought spices and Pav
My classes had been started from yesterday morning at nine o'clock and classes will continue till four o'clock in the evening everyday
I reach Library every morning at nine am to attend my classes
My classes are conducting online so I go to Library
Today I will do my work on time because it is getting late every day
I have a lot of work today so I won't be able to meet you
Last night I went to take medicine, I have been geting fever from two days
My Parents are going to Temple tomorrow and I will also go with them
I go to study in Library which is about seven kilometers away from my home
I had to borrow a Laptop from a friend to watch online classes
Because I don't have my own Laptop and my Mobile Phone is also not in a good condition
I also got my own private seat at Library so I go everyday to study
Sitting in the boat my parents have performed <Ganga> puja for me
My friend <Lucky> also came, we all went together
I have come today by vehicle, let's visit somewhere and call Shivani too
I was also thinking that I should go somewhere for a visit, it would be a lot of fun
Everyone's microphone was always on in the online class
I have ordered a <Bag> it will arrive by tomorrow afternoon but I have no money
It is not necessary that all online goods come fine, sometimes bad goods also come
Out of all the items I have ordered online so far, very few items have been good
I order most of the online stuff from <Flipkart>, that's fine for me
Mona orders most of her stuff from <Amazon> because she likes <Amazon>
Once when I was in Agra I also ordered goods from <Amazon>
I found <Myntra> also good for shopping and nowadays it is the era of <Meesho>
All the goods are available at cheap in <Meesho> and many times good quality goods are available
There are very few <Meesho> items that turn out to be defective
Whatever it is, everyone always buys online goods based on reviews
<Zee News> once conducted a survey and found that reviews should never be trusted
In Reviews and Ratings most of the company's own people correct the wrong ones
Anyway, my Father said always try to buy things from your local area
There are two benefits of buying goods from nearby, one is that the person from whom you buy will benefit and second is that you will buy the goods only after seeing them in front of you
Buying things from nearby also increases mutual love
Anyways in trouble, online people will not come to help, whenever anyone comes, it will be neighbours only
I also agree with my Father that the entire Country buys goods online only
But neighbors only trust their own villagers
Sometimes the problem was that there were two shops selling the same goods at the same place
We also have two , three similar vegetable shops here
If we buy vegetable from one place then others will feel bad for not buying vegetables from their place
Earlier, when I used to buy vegetables from my Uncle's place, <Sanjay> Uncle used to feel very bad
Now I buy Vegetables from Grandma's place on <Railway Line> only
Even then <Shiv Brother> felt bad that I did not buy Vegetables from him
This is the problem, whose face will you see?
Hey, do you know what today is?
I too did not remember but <Sweetu> only reminded me
<Valentine> week has started from today and today is the first day, Rose Day
Now this whole week something will keep happening one day at a time
There is a big advantage of <Valentine> week and that is that business remains very good throughout the week
Today there will be a lot of <Rose> marketing and you will get one Rose for at least twenty or thirty rupees
Today, red, yellow and white colorful roses are being sold in the market
It is believed to give <Red Rose> to someone you love
My friend was telling me that <Yellow Roses> was given to friends
And even if you ever have a fight, you can become friends again by giving a <White Rose> to your Friend and forgetting your old differences
Hey, but nowadays people's attitude have become so high that who wants to bow first?
Well if you want to fight with someone then you can give them <Black Rose>
By fight I mean ending the conversation, not beating
In world people have so much brain that they have different concepts for Colours
Last year on this day when I went to Agra, <Sweetu> also gave me lots of Roses
This time I forgot that today is <Rose Day>
But today I didn't have seen <Rose> shop anywhere
It seems I was late and I came in a hurry and I didn't paid any attention
Anyway, my brain is working less these days
My head has so much pain that it feels as if someone is hitting me every now and then
My head has never in pain as much as it has in the last two days
Today I am thinking of buying medicine for headache and eating it
My head has so much pain that I can't even see properly with my eyes
Today I also got a call from <Juhi>, she is also not well
Don't know what kind of weather is going on, everyone's health is getting disturbed
See, my Father and Mother are also not feeling well these days
When I went out to drink Tea, a boy was also drinking Tea keeping a <Rose Flower> in a foil
It seemed that the boy had kept <flowers> to give to his girlfriend
Today after so many days <Shivani> has come to meet me
<Shivani> was asking me where she has to come to meet?
This afternoon <Sweetu> felt like eating Rava Dosa so we went to <Vishwanath Temple>
I, <Mona> and <Sweetu> are enjoying the dosa of  <Vishwanath Temple>
But since two times when we are going there to eat <Rava Dosa> we are not getting Dosa there
Today I don't feel like going to College because I have a lot of work
But I also wanted to meet <Shivani> so I went to meet <Shivani>
Now tomorrow morning I have to go to A.T.M to withdraw money
Tomorrow I have some work to do at home so I won't go to College tomorrow
<Shivani> had to do party with <Sweetu> so today we went to <Banaras Restaurant> to eat something
At <Banaras Restaurant> we had eaten Chowmein, Kadhai Paneer and Butter Chapati
In <Chowmein> Paneer had mixed as if it was burnt
<Shivani> was complaining to the waiter there but <Mona> refused
Today's <Butter Tandoori Chapati> was also served with a lot of burning for some reason, don't know why?
It seemed as if the Cook was expressing his anger over the food
It's okay, the promise made to <Shivani> has now been fulfilled atleast
<Mona> has also promised <Juhi> to feed her Maldahiya's Baati Chokha
Once I also went to <Bati Chokha Restaurant> in <Maldahiya>
I thought the restaurant was too expensive but the atmosphere there is very nice
We went to <Bati Chokha Restaurant> to eat Bati Chokha in the year Two Thousand Twenty Two
My Computer's Antivirus is expired and I need to install it too
Now if some day I get time, I will go to <Gomti Market> and get my Laptop repairing done
Earlier, when my Laptop ran out of Antivirus, I used to tell <Kishan> Brother
<Kishan> Brother used to fill Antivirus in my Laptop in less rate
Now there is no point in <bothering> him every time
So this time I will go to <D.L.W Market> and buy Antivirus myself
Anti virus is also not good from all companies, I think only <Quick Heal> is good
<Aarti> had C.T.E.T exam today and she had to go to Lucknow
Yesterday <Aarti> asked me to go Lucknow with her
Now if someone asks you to go to <Lucknow> so quickly, how can you go?
And by the way, you know, my Father doesn't let me go anywhere like this
Nowadays people are so ungrateful that just don't ask
You know for whom I'm talking about, I get very angry at some people sometimes
I spoke to <Aarti> this evening and she told me that she didn't went to appear in the exam
If you have to go to <Lucknow> then you should have prepared for it in advance, right?
<Aarti> was saying that I am not getting a seat in the Train, so I said that the Train does not belong to your Grandfather
Just two days ago there were eighty thousand rupees in <Lucky's> account and within two days it has reduced to forty thousand
You know many people have helped us in building our house
My Father used to say that unless there is God's grace, nothing can happen to anyone
My Sentence Composition work is not completed yet and I have to submit this by <Sunday>
The work has to be submitted by <Sunday> and not even half of the work has been completed
I think this time I will definitely hear scolding from Sir and Madam
I have a meeting with <Prashant> sir tomorrow and I also have to give him a report
I am wondering what I will say to Sir and <Sandhya sister>?
Today I thought that I would sit and work the whole day and complete around twelve hundred to thirteen hundred sentences
What can I tell you, the work of house construction has also started from today and I also have to help my Mother
I don't know why this always happens to me when it comes to work?
What can I do now?  Both tasks are important, I will work hard to complete both
I always tell my friend not to be stressed about anything
My friend always take stress, what can I say now?
I explained everything to him but he still doesn't understand
I have given my Book to the shop for binding
I have sent a message to <Mona> asking her to go and get my <Book>
Mona had gone to collect my book this afternoon and in the evening she returned the <Book> to me
I asked <Mona> how much is the bill and she said that her Uncle had not told her
Previously I already have got done more <Books> binding from Mona's Uncle's shop
Just this afternoon <Mona> was asking where I am, but I couldn't have seen the message
Yesterday <Ramu's> Mother was asking me where I had gone
I think she saw me at <Ravidas Temple>, right?
I also feel that she had seen me and that's why she was asking
I don't have any problem if she had seen
I have to go to my friend's house for puja so I will leave at seven in the morning
If you have to go at seven in the morning then go and sleep, then only you will be able to get up early in the morning to go by <Bus>
I am not feeling sleepy right now, what should I do, how to sleep?
I told my Mother to wake me up at five thirty in the morning
Looking at my Mother, it seems that she will wake me up at five o'clock in the morning
I always tell my friend to take good care of himself, but he doesn't follow
Today after class I went to my friend's house now his house construction is going on
I get up late every morning and I am also late in going to <Library>
I named my friend Kariya because he is Black

My phone is broken and looks like I'll have to buy a new phone
Now I will buy the phone either on my birthday or after my birthday
This <February> I also have to buy a <Vehicle>, I am wondering whether to buy it or not?
I am thinking of buying it because sometimes my Mother faces difficulty in traveling
Before going anywhere with Mother , I have to think ten times as to how to go?
Now it is not pleasant to take Mother anywhere on <bicycle> and it is also not safe for her
One time I was taking my Mother to get medicine and she fell down
The case is that my bicycle hit the sand and when I applied the brakes, my <bicycle> fell
As soon as the bicycle overturned, both I and my Mother fell on the <sand>
Fortunately, by the grace of God at that time, we were not injured at all
One more time I am going to get my Aadhar Card made near D.L.W Cinema Hall
When I was returning from there, I had dropped my Mother from the bicycle
I went to my School on time every day and came home on time
In my School <Samosa> was very good and its chutney was also very tasty

Yes yes, I have also eaten Samosas of <Assi>, one Samosa costs fifteen rupees there
Samosas of <Assi> also contain nuggets of Cheese and Almonds

Dad told Mom that if she kept all the Vegetables wrapped in cloth, they would last longer
I also had to give vegetables to <Bulbul> but I did not call her because I don't know whether she will take the vegetables or not
Well, it's good that my Uncle had brought a sack of potatoes, otherwise I would have had to buy potatoes tomorrow
There are very nice sweets in my house, but I don't know why I don't feel like eating anything
I don't know why I've been feeling very upset from these past few days
I don't feel good from inside, it feels like I'm so confused
Well, I don't have any complications in my mind, but I don't know what's bothering me so much
I didn't notice that today is the third day of Valentine's Week that is <Chocolate Day>
When I came to the Library in the morning, <Sweetu> gave Chocolates to me and <Mona>
If you are having headache then eat <Chocolate> or drink Coffee to get relief from it
You eat headache tablet everyday, therefore you are not getting how much harm it causes
You know, <Neetu's> Mother also ordered tablet when she had stomach ache and how much trouble she had to face later
If I had known in advance that today was <Chocolate Day>, I would have told my Father to bring Chocolates for our shop
He could not understand that how many customers had come for <Chocolate> since morning

She was saying that she don't want to buy books, if someone has them then someone should send her
Right now everyone's exams are going on, so who will give her book,isn't it
If she takes anyone's books she doesn't return them
Wherever we go by <Train>, we take our food with us

Please tell which book are you reading? Hey, I am reading the story of <Munsi Premchand> only

<Ramu> is asking if there is any advantage in buying books online?
I got a wound on my leg and it is very painful
When we do any exercise, we also do relaxing postures
Yesterday I had an evening class, so I sat down at night and made notes of it
Today I thought I would call <Neelam> madam in the evening

I feel that I should also prepare for this exam otherwise I will not clear
Whenever I think that I will not make any mistake, then only some mistake happens somehow
Yesterday when I was washing my Clothes I found a two thousand rupee note inside it
I got it after washing all Clothes till then it already turned wet

Yes, it is really necessary to ride a <bicycle> for half an hour every day
Now that Summer has come, I will come to Library everyday at eight o'clock
Yes, it would be better to come early in the morning otherwise it gets very sunny
Every morning you see only Kalachakra in Newspaper and don't you have any work to do?
Yes, you also watch Cricket every day, then why are you targeting me?

Today we have to create a great model on Moral Education
It should take nearly ten days to make model, will it be fine?
Do you have any good book for N.E.T exam which I can read to get good percentage for <N.E.T>?
I have a book called <Ringo Baby> to prepare for paper two but there is not much good content given in it
Oh, in my opinion, we should prepare as per syllabus
Last time I thought that I would have clear N.E.T but I don't know where the luck got stuck, I can't understand
See, there is a time for everything and whatever is meant to happen, happens
My <Father> once told me that everything has its time
I have now left everything to God and surrendered everything to him
<Devika> Mataji is like my spiritual guru and she has also become my good friend
<Devika> Mataji and <Soumya> Mataji have taught so many good things to me
Once  on Facebook I filled the Bhagavad Gita's form on Iskcon <Bangalore> site
Now I am associated with <Iskcon Bangalore> and <Iskcon Varanasi> and have met many people there
In class Prabhuji was telling us about <Vaishnav> crime
Yesterday when I sent an emoji on <Sandhya Di's> status then she was calling me Bengaluru
Today I have also told <Sandhya Di> that I will definitely come to <Bangalore> and hang out with her
This time when there will be a Project meeting, I will definitely go to <Bangalore> and I have to meet a lot of people there
I have to meet <Prashant> sir, <Dikshita> madam and <Sandhya> sister at IISc
Once <Sandhya> Di also came to our <Banaras> but I could not meet her
When <Sandhya> Di came to <Vishwanath Temple> of <B.H.U>, she did not informed me
I wanted to meet <Sandhya Di> but despite many efforts I could not meet her
<Sandhya Di> had said that she would come to <Banaras> again in <February> because she liked <Banaras> very much
Now that February is about to end, why will <Sandhya Di> come now in <February>?
The days pass so quickly that we don't realize anything, look, <January> has passed and we don't realize anything
Like others this year too will pass and we won't even know anything
But I think this year has brought a lot for me
I Just pray to God that everything goes very well and whatever is good for me, will happen
Anyway, you know that God does not do anything bad for us, he only does good
The wise men have said that there is a reason behind everything and without a reason nothing happens
Why King <Shantanu> asked the question to Ma <Ganga>, because if he had not asked the question then <Ganga Ma> would have neither left him nor there would have been any Mahabharata
There is a big reason behind everything but we cannot understand it
I have a madam from <Agra> who makes very good curry, you will know if you eat it
The specialty of <Neelam Madam> curry is that she prepares it by adding buttermilk
Madam once told me that her Sister taught her to make <Curry>
I have to go to <Agra> once again to submit a copy of my thesis
Whenever I go, I will go quickly because as soon as <Neelam> madam remembers, she will starts irritating me
Whenever I go to <Agra>, this time I will definitely go to <Barsana>, I have been waiting to go their from a long time
This time I have so many plans in my mind and every time I have plans but what can I tell you they all fail
I very much feel like staying the night in <Mathura> and going to <Banke Bihari Temple> for Aarti in the morning
I think <Mona> has come after me to get information about me
You know that in <Sarnath> <Lord Buddha> gave his first sermon to his five disciples
<Lord Buddha> is considered to be the ninth incarnation of <Krishna> who gave the message of love and peace to the world
We heard the story of <Lord Buddha> in childhood, his childhood name was Siddhartha
<Sarnath> is a very big place in Banaras which is considered to be a very big place of Buddhism
Earlier, when I was in B.A, I used to go to <Sarnath> very often
There is also a Zoo in <Sarnath>, many beautiful native and foreign birds were there
When I was young  for the first time I went to <Sarnath> with my Father
There were also <Crocodiles> and <Foxes> in <Sarnath Zoo>, whose meat was given to eat
Today <Mona> had to go to <B.H.U> to get the Books but she did not go
How can work be done like this, when no one will do the work then you will have to do your work, right
I feel as if there is no cure for me, if only someone could slap me a couple of times
Have you ever gone to <Annapurna Temple> of <Vishwanath Temple> for eating food?
The idol of <Annapurna Ma> was stolen by a thief and sold in abroad
<Modi ji> is so nice that he found the idol and brought it back
If you want to have darshan of <Annapurna Mai> then <Annapurna Temple> doors opens only on <Dhanteras>
On <Dhanteras> there is so much crowd in <Annapurna Temple> that there is not even a place to put one's feet
I went there for the first time with my whole family for <Simple's> wedding
In the food of <Annapurna Temple> one can eat sambar, rice, potato bhujia, sweets, curd and papad
<Mona> loves Sambar Rice from <Annapurna Temple> and so do I
Do you know that these days beautiful corridors of all <Temples> are being built?
Just a few days ago I saw the corridor of <Mahakal Temple> in <Ujjain> on Telivision
Now I think I should rest for ten minutes because I have class at Three Thirty
I have heard that the Temple of <Ram ji> will also be ready in <Ayodhya> in Two Thousand Twenty Four
Well, it's good, anyway, Hindu society has struggled a lot to build <Ram Mandir>
When the Temple is ready, I will definitely go there with my Parents and <Sweetu>
Hey, you know that on the day of <Ratjagga> we used to get very big jalebis
I said that on the day of <Ratjagga> people eat roasted grains and jalebis with great pleasure
There are many other Festivals whose trend is now vanishing in our side
In the first Sawan, many swings were put up at our place and we swing with all enthusiasm
In olden times every festival was celebrated as a Utsav
Nowadays people do not have enough time to pay attention to festivals and celebrations
Now celebration of <Holi> <Diwali> is a big thing for people
My Mother says that earlier on <Nag Panchami> there used to be a lot of Kabaddi, there used to be organization of wrestling at the Akhara
Nowadays Akhara is no where visible, otherwise earlier only Akhara was visible everywhere
It is very good that I wAS born before the year two thousand, otherwise I would not have known anything about our Culture
Now it seems as if all the children are born with a mobile phone
Now look at that <Aarav>, who is busy with his mobile all day long, when he eats, he uses his mobile, when he sits, he uses his mobile
Without a mobile phone no one's life runs , be it a child or an adult, everyone needs a mobile phone
This <Holi> I have to buy a lot of things so I am saving money
Look, <Holi> is near but I haven't saved even a single rupee yet
I have to buy at least two jeans and shoes for myself and two sarees for my Mother
I will also buy something for my Father because when I ask him to take something, he will say, you take it, I already have everything
This Holi I want to buy something nice for my <Sweetu> too
Now you tell me, it will cost ten thousand to buy this much
I think I should do some work for a month to earn this ten thousand rupees
I can't do anything even if I want to because I have a lot of exams next month
Today on Chocolate Day I also had to go to <Radha Krishna> Temple taking Chocolate for <Kanha>
This evening, I have a promotional meeting with <Soumya Mataji> so I will cook food soon and be free on time
Cooking is also a daily challenge when you go to cook and you don't know what to cook
Today is <Thursday> so Kadhi Rice will be prepared at your house, should I also come with you?
Open gyms are being built at many places in <B.H.U>, I don't understand what will be the benefit of this?
According to my knowledge, four gyms have been built so far in <B.H.U>
There is a gym next to the canteen in our <Women's College> where girls focus on exercise less and focus more on talking to their boyfriends
The second gym is near the guest house at <Triveni Chowk> where sometimes people are seen doing exercise
The third gym is near the <Physical Education Department> of <Sweetu> where the younger children of <Kendriya Vidyalaya> play
And the fourth one is on the road to <Health Center> where no one ever goes
Now you tell me, it would have been better if instead V.C sir has planted more Trees
The former V.C was amazing than current , he used to get cut Trees everytime
Earlier, there used to be so many trees in our <B.H.U> that the weather there was always cooler than everywhere else
Which tree is not in our campus, you will find every Medicinal Tree in B.H.U
I think the most beautiful is our <B.H.U>, where you won't want to leave once you come
There is a new <Vishwanath Temple> in our College where tourists from all over the world come to visit
Today a Mat seller came near my house and my Mother called out to stop him
There should be one or two separate Mats in the house, in case someone comes, it will be better for them to sit
<Golu Uncle's > Mother also wanted to buy two Mats, so she asked the Mat seller at what price was he offering the Mats?
The Mat seller was giving a Mat for One Hundred and Fifty Rupees and Aunty was asking him to give it on the right price
Aunt was telling the Mat seller that if you quote the right price then I would like to purchase four Mats
The Mat seller had quoted a price of One Hundred Thirty Rupees per Mat, but everyone said that it was too expensive
After a lot of requests, the Mat seller agreed to One Hundred and Twenty Rupees but my Aunt and Mother said that they would only give One Hundred Rupees
Finally he agreed to Hundred Rupees and Four Mats of worth Four Hundred Rupees each were purchased
Just imagine that the Mat seller yesterday had loss of Two Hundred Rupees
Anyway, we should not negotiate with hawkers, poor people walk all day for earn Two Paisa
Just today I read in Newspaper that a terrible fire broke out in a Mattress shop in Marauli
I am surprised to think how much loss Shop Owner might have suffered?
Fire Brigade people went and controlled the fire after a lot of effort
Today I did not feel like going to the Library from home, I just felt like going to Temple
What can I do?  I have so much work that I am not able to go to Temple even if I want to
Tomorrow is <Saturday>, tomorrow I will definitely go to <Sankat Mochan Temple> and stay there for at least two hours
We must go to Temple atleast once in a week
Man does everything for happiness and peace and if there is no peace of mind, then what is the point of any work?
I can't understand why my mind has been so unsettled in these past few days?
Guruji said that for mental peace we should do sadhana for at least one hour every day
Every day I have to send my Sadhana Card to the WhatsApp group of seekers, but I do not do this
Yesterday when night class was going on, I joined the class and started talking to <Sweetu>
Yesterday in class I was talking to <Sweetu> and <Soumya Mataji> was calling my name many times
I was not listening to <Soumya Mataji> therefore <Devika Mataji> scolded me a lot
Come on, next time I won't make such mistake even if I go to class a little late, but will work carefully
What can I tell you, this Sentence Composition task is not getting done, I am tired of doing it
I have to complete my Sentence Composition work by day after tomorrow, please tell me how should I do it?
I am thinking of asking for one week's extension from <Sandhya Dii> to complete the work
No, I will somehow finish this work in four five days
If I ask for a week's time for Sentence Composition then the next week will be spent in this
I have to do study and I have an exam too next week but what can I do, I am not feeling well
These days, I have to do so much work at home that I don't even have time to study
I think I should take out some time for myself but I don't have any free time from work
Yesterday when I called <Ajay Brother> he was saying that he is still at my Aunt's place
<Ajay Brother> does not understand why sister in law is waiting for him?
Okay, tell me, where do you want to go, I will take you there
I don't want to go anywhere, I just want to go somewhere in peace away from the hustle and bustle of this world
Okay, then take your stuff and go to <Himalayas>, no one will bother you there
You know that peace is just a feeling of human mind, if your mind is calm then you will feel good even in the crowd
That's why I tell you to keep yourself calm and give yourself time
I don't understand why my mind is so troubled?
Oh, today is the fourth day of Valentine's Day, what is this day called?
In my opinion today is Teddy Day and on this day everyone gives Teddy to each other
This morning Father had to fill water on the terrace so I was late in coming today
There is so much work in the morning that I wonder what my Mother will do alone, so these days I am helping her
Nowadays, I cook every evening and morning because my Mother is very tired
Yesterday my Father had to spend the whole day carrying sand from <Karan Uncle's> house and bringing it back to the house
<Karan> Uncle's Mother was saying that their house is also going to be built, so their gravel and sand will also dump today
That's why we had to clean our sand gravel from <Golu Uncle's> door today
When Grandfather comes back in two four days, the work on the stairs at our place will start
Now that the roof is built we need a ladder to go up
I am doing my work very well, I am wondering whether I should finish the work now?
I had to cook this morning, so I have a headache now

There is a Fish Market in <Sunderpur>, I witness it every day
It's been a long time since I saw <Aditya>, where is he?
Hey, don't even ask about <Aditya>, it seems his attitude has increased a lot these days
How can you say that his attitude has raised, you used to live with him earlier
No, these days he has become very studious, that's why I am saying this
These days he doesn't even talk to me
Okay, earlier when he used to hang out with you, so it was okay, right?
Now that he starts focusing on his work then you are feeling quite jealous
Now he may also have something else in mind, just roaming around doesn't work, right?
Fine let it be, now I will not say anything neither to him nor to anyone
Last night my <Grandmother> and Aunt came so I had to cook a lot of food
You know I made Brinjal Curry, Rice and Chapati last night
How will I know, I didn't have came to check in your house?
I am observing, these days you are only asking about <Aditya> everyday, is there any problem?
These days Aditya has become very selfish that's why I talk about him
Yesterday four earthy colored <Chairs> were purchased for our house
This time all the Chairs look great and are very comfortable to sit on
I'm thinking of giving one of these Chairs to you, tell me, would you like it?
I don't know why today even my right eye is fluttering so hard, it feels like something good is about to happen
Tell me what do you think what good will be happen to me?
Hey, it's not like that, sometimes eye flutters usually
You notice, something good will happen to you today, I am telling you
There may be something that is good for you and you don't even know it
Yesterday <Shivani> was asking me that I observed that you are very sad from the last two four days
I was wondering how she knew that I am sad
<Shivani> was saying that she already had a thought to ask what has happened to me ?
She thought someone had said something to me or that I was upset thinking about home
I told <Shivani> that I am definitely sad but I am not worried about anything
Do you know what <Shivani> said to me then?
So <Shivani> was asking me are you missing someone?
She was saying this to make me laugh and then we both started laughing very loudly
I told <Shivani> nothing like that, I just didn't feel right
After that I talked to <Shivani> for some time and by then my Father came to teach Rishav
These days even Choti is not coming to classes, I don't know what has happened to her
I asked <Rishabh> yesterday and he told me that her health is not good
Sister, this March weather is also like that, everyone's health is deteriorating

It's good that your center is also there, wandering together we will go
If you want to go with me, you will have to get fill my vehicle with fuel
Then you let me go, I can sit in the yellow bus of <Modi> and go
If I have to pay you to go with you, won't I go with my own means?
Then you go to your way, I won't take anyone for free at all
<Aditya> what do you think, if you don't take me then I won't be able to appear in the exam?
I will ask someone else and go with him for my exam
Do you know where <Ashapur> is and it will cost you a hundred or two hundred rupees to go ?
Even if you go by your own vehicle, it will take two liters of petrol
Will you eat Matar Paneer Curry, Jeera Rice and Puri?
Go quickly to <Shivkumar> shop and get two packets of buttermilk and I will also make <Raita> for you
I just want to eat some simple food today so you just make Dal Bhaat for me
Should I make Dal Bhaat and some Potato Fries in ten minutes?
If you are able to make Jeera Aaloo Curry then make it for me
Don't know why these days I like to eat Chapati coated with Butter
Hey, think a while and then eat Butter otherwise eating too much will make your stomach bulge out
I don't eat that much Butter that bulge out my stomach, I take care of myself
I was very tired of doing my work so by vehicle I have come to College with <Sweetu>
Mood will fresh up in College, then I have to go back and do work
I was very hungry so I bought sevda from <Bhailal> Uncle in ten rupees
I have eaten Idli and drank Tea in the College canteen today
Today, till now I have drank Tea twice, now I will not drink Tea in the evening, you can have
In the evening when I go home, I will make chestnut pudding and will eat it, I like it alot
Since last one month we are not purchasing Milk, so I am not able to make Coffee too
I think due to not drinking milk my body has become weak
<Lucky> was telling me that if you do not have milk then you should eat fifty grams of <cheese> every day
Now I am also thinking of eating fifty grams of cheese a day
From now on I will buy cheese from <Bengal> sweet shop and eat it on every alternate day
<Bengali> shop sweets are good and not adulterated so I will buy from there
Oh, I have written a lot of sentences but I don't know how my page got erased
You know who <Madhavaj> people are? Now you will say what I started talking about?
<Madhavaj> are people of Mathura who sing bhajans in a group
I have formed so many sentences since morning that now I don't know what to write?
Hey, today I had to send work to two people, I forgot
Do you know <Gaur Gopal> Prabhuji? He is very famous
I have also listened to <Gopal Prabhu ji> many times on YouTube, my mind feels very relaxed after listening to him
<Aditya> was saying that when he completes Diploma in Massage he will become a Physiotherapist
When <Aditya> will becomes a Massage Therapist, I will get my forehead massaged by him
You know that <Aadi> is studying from a very big College of <Patiala>
For his studies <Aditya> is going to <Patiala> from <Punjab>
If my exams are over by then, then maybe I can go to <Patiala> with them
<Sweetu> was just telling me that if he works hard he will earn four or five thousand rupees a day
I think every day out of four or five thousand I will get at least one thousand rupees
I definitely have to open a School in the future, for this I have to earn a lot of money
Now I don't have desire to work, so now I am working reluctantly
Now two types of Tea are available in <Women's College>, one is special and one is normal
Do you even have any idea how many <Samosas> you eat in a month?
I don't understand what kind of clothes girls wear these days
R.O water is available in our library but it is most pure
I have heard that drinking too much pure water is the first thing that causes tooth decay
Even drinking too much pure water damages our health
Man should drink clean and pure water, it is not necessary to drink purified water
You know, Sweetu and mine learning driving license is ready
Dad was saying that you should get your permanent license in a month
The Lawyer Uncle who made our license has taken fifteen hundred rupees from us
Now if I want to get permanent license then I will have to pay him thirty five hundred rupees more
After a month I will call and ask Lawyer Uncle and then will give him money
I also want my license to be issued soon so that I can buy vehicle soon
Just in the evening when I was coming home there was a lot of traffic jam at crossroad
I was very late in coming home because I was very late in coming back from College
I have parked my Bicycle at <Bhulanpur> station
While coming back I remembered that my Bindi was also finished
On the way to <Nathupur> I saw a shop where Bindis were being sold
I stopped at the Bindi shop to buy Bindi but I had no money
I asked the shopkeeper if I could make online payment then he said no
Now you tell how will I go to College tomorrow without Bindi?
I don't feel good without Bindi so I put Bindi everyday
If I will search my box, I will definetely find some Bindi, so I will put it
When I came home, I saw <Sharmili> madam had come and was waiting to meet me
When I came home I had to go to <Shivkumar> Uncle to get milk
I brought Milk, then made Tea and gave it to everyone to drink
I think drinking excessive tea is causing weakness of my knee bones
Meanwhile, my leg was having a lot of pain, that's why I was saying so
<Sharmili> Madam speaks so much that I was getting angry listening to her
So I was not listening to <Sharmili> madam and started doing my work
The admission form for <Bangalore> exam has also arrived but I am not going to appear in this exam
It seems that the entire exam will be conducted in this month itself
No preparation was done, will simply appear in exam
Today I woke up early in the morning so that I can make at least fifty sentences in the morning
Is getting up at six o'clock is a<morning? If you get up at five o'clock, something will be done
I thought I would had wake up at five o'clock but I don't know why I don't get up early
As soon as I woke up in the morning, my Mother said, quickly help me in doing work and then go to College
Today is <Saturday> and I have to leave the house a little early
I have decided that every Saturday I will go to <Sankat Mochan> and recite Sundar Kand
<Sankat Mochan> is very far from our house, say ten kilometers
I have been working continuously since I woke up in the morning but my work is not yet finished
I don't know why only Bati Chokha and Khichdi are prepared in my house every <Saturday>
When I was in <Agra>, Chokha is not made there like it is made here
I said that Chokha is made by roasting Potatoes, Brinjal and Tomatoes in fire, but I don't know how brother <Raju> used to make it like a Vegetable
Once when I was eating mess's chokha, a worm had come out of it
By the way, <Suresh> bro and <Raju> bro cook very good food in the mess
Now I have lit the cowdung and wood, once the fire is ready I will roast <potatoes> and <brinjal>
On one side, I will make <Chokha> and on the other side, I will also make arrangements to make Baati
How much time will it take to make <Khichdi>? You just keep looking at me and everything will be done
Today we will eat Khichdi and Chokha and then go to College
I don't know why I don't like Baati, and how people eat it
Don't know why eating Baati hurts my stomach a lot so I don't eat it
If you don't like Baati then will no one will eat it because of you?
I am not denying anyone to eat, I am just expressing my opinion
Today my father has also gone to the field with my bicycle, let's see when he returns
I was thinking of going a little early today because the <Sankat Mochan> Temple closes by Eleven o'clock
By the time your Father comes, you should finish all your work and be ready
Do you know what happened to the form your Father filled out to play football?
Father's first match is on Sunday at M.P Theater against <Nagaland>
Listen, will you come with me to watch my Father's match, it will be wonderful
Anyway, the match is going to be scheduled on Sunday and you will be free on that day
Fine, I will also come to watch your Father's match, your Father is as my father
I'm going to buy lots of chips and crisps and will eat these and watch match
I just pray to God that may my Father's team wins the entire match
If Father's team wins the entire match then he will have to go to <Germany> to play for India
Think how big opportunity it is that Father will go to <Germany> to play Football on behalf of India
Hey, it's about Nine o'clock, don't you have to go today?
I have a lot of work to do, don't bother me, you go, I'll catch you there
Right now, brother is working at <Mahinder> Uncle's place, from there when he will got free time he will work at my place
Has your Bati Chokha been made or were you just boasting?
I have been hungry from long and you please don't boast much
This morning Mother had added so much jaggery in the Tea that it felt as if I was drinking Juice and not Tea
These days my stomach doesn't feel right and I always feel full
You do one thing, wake up early every morning and drink at least one glass of hot water
From today I have also started eating Aloevera in the morning
I've been watching you ever since, you're just talking about food but your stomach is upset
Don't you know that even talking about eating too much causes stomach upset?
Now let's do some study, that will be useful for you
What about stomach, it is a pit that will never be filled
Today early morning I got a message from mega shop that they have some offers for Holi
I went to <Sankat Mochan> Temple today and there was a lot of crowd there today
Today is <Saturday> so there was a lot of crowd
I sat there for about two hours today
Today there was a very good kirtan in the <Sankat Mochan> Temple, it was very nice experience there
I didn't have class today so I went to Temple
Today after Kirtan there we also got Sweets
Today the crowd was so huge that a stand was made outside for parking
I parked the vehicle there because I am afraid of losing vehicle in the crowd
Today I am too late in coming home, I came after Ten Thirty
I am going to work now because it has been a long time since I worked
On Fourteenth I also have an exam of <Kendriya Vidyalaya> and I think I won't go
I haven't studied anything for the <Kendriya Vidyalaya> exam
The exam center has also moved towards <hills> and I am wondering how to go?
The examination pattern of <Central School> has also changed this time
I think I should give exam this will create an experience for the next exam
Tomorrow is <Sunday> and I have a lot of work to do tomorrow
I feel that <Sunday> may never come, but what should I do, it always comes
I have to cook food again this evening, tell me what should I do now?
In the morning I cook food and come and after being so tired again have to go home and cook
All this is the cause of my headache these days
I don't know why I feel so hungry while working
I woke up today in the morning and thought about working but couldn't get anything done
Today I'm thinking about working till late, let's see what happens
It's very hot in the library today but what should I do, I can't even turn on the fan
Last night I slept without turning off WiFi in my mobile
I feel like I can't work like I use to do
This evening I have to make Chooda Matar too, Peas have brought in abundance
Is there anything in your house that you have to make Chooda Matar?
My Grandmother has come and she wants to eat Chooda Matar, so I will have to make it
Today I played a song of <Lata Mangeshkar> on my Laptop
I love listening to <Lata Mangeshkar>'s songs so I always listen to them
Tonight I will watch a movie, will you come to my house to watch the movie?
I had to make Tea four times this morning
I don't know what has happened these days, I don't have getting any money
I used to think the best thing was sleep, but now I don't like it anymore
I feel that the government should also enforce that a child should drive a vehicle only after completing graduation
Nowadays many accidents happen of small children
I don't know why I feel like going out on a visit for a few days
Traveling is okay, but how can one go alone? Will you go along ?
I can't even ask anyone to come along to travel because no one is free
Not everyone has enough time to Travel like we do
It costs a lot of money to travel and who has the money to spend in travel?
Now I mostly stay at my home only, where will I go and with whom will I go?
Today I don't feel like doing any work but I'm still working
Today I have run out of water and I will have to go and buy water too
I'm thinking of staying in the library for eight or ten hours to study
Take a room near library and study comfortably
In Laptops and Mobile work should always be done keeping the lights on
Since morning I have drink Tea one time only
When you eat Khichdi you get hungry very quickly, I am very hungry
If you are going out, buy some Almond Pakodas for me
Now don't say that if I will come with you then you will brought it
There is so much crowd on the road today that I was feeling very angry while coming
I think I should go and eat something, otherwise I will feel hungry and it won't feel good
Recently when I went out to have Tea, an Aunt was giving Eighty rupees to her son
You know, in my home it is believed that one should not get a haircut done on <Saturday>
That Aunt was giving money to her son only for haircut
I said that no one gets haircut on <Tuesday>, Thursday and Sunday because these are considered as bad days
I have heard from someone that one should not get hair cut even on the day of Ekadashi
Now Holi is about to come, so offer messages are coming on mobile from everywhere
This morning I got a message from <Mega Shop> and now I have also received a message from Trends
The <pink> kurti I wear is purchased from Trends
Along with pink kurti, grey colored kurti was also bought from Trends
Why don't you ever wear <Grey Kurti>?
Whenever I buy two clothes together, one of them turns out to be damaged for some reason, I don't know why?
Grey kurti has turned out very bad, in looks it is good but it is not easy to wear
Last time on Holi also I bought two jeans together
You know, that time both my jeans were ruined
Both of my jeans are discolored and both look very ugly in appearance
I feel like I will definitely buy one black jeans this Holi
How do you like Black Jeans?
I like white shirt with black jeans and <black shirt> with <grey jeans>
By the way, I like pants more than jeans
Don't think so much, for me you look good in any color clothes
Tomorrow <Babita> sister and brother in law <Bablu> will come to my house to meet me
I am thinking that my sister and brother in law should not come to home tomorrow because I have very important work tomorrow
Hey, why are you saying this, guests are the form of God, aren't they?
Tell me which singer's song is your favorite ?
It is not necessary that I like listening to any one singer only
I listen to songs as per my mood, I like to listen to the songs of <Jubin>, <Arjit> most
Tell me, from when did you start liking listening to new songs?  Is your mind fine ?
I'm telling you, I listen to songs as per my mood
Mostly I listen to devotional songs of Poonam Dii or Jaya Kishori only
I no longer park my bicycle at the <D.L.W> Hospital
Now when I have to go somewhere, I go straight to Library and park my bicycle there
Parking my bicycle in the library also saves my ten rupees weekly
Now I don't want to give space to many people in my life because everyone has a dual character
Anyway, everything should not be told to everyone, in this world everyone takes advantage of everything
Nowadays, people do not have just one face, behind that face there is another face
Now I understand everyone better, no one can tolerate someone's happiness
In this world everyone boast a lot but they can only boast
What has happened to you, why are you doing so much discussion?
Listen, you said you wanted to celebrate the weekend on <Saturday>, then why are you sleeping?
I have a lot of Clothes to wash tomorrow, are you listening?
I am worried thinking that how I will wash all the Clothes tomorrow?
Now you have Washing Machine in your home but you are still worried
Don't worry, give me your clothes, I will wash your clothes tomorrow
Scrub my Clothes very thoroughly so that they get completely clean
What will you give me if I wash your Clothes?
I remember the best time I ever had was from Two Thousand Seventeen to Two Thousand Nineteen
I got admission in <Kashi Hindu University> in the year Two Thousand Seventeen
Earlier I thought that I would not get admission in <Linguistics>
By the grace of God, I got admission in <Linguistics> in the main campus only
And more, in Two Thousand Seventeen, I made a lot of new friends
After getting admission in <B.H.U>, I felt good
I didn't know anything about <Linguistics> before I did graduation
That time we had lots of fun together in the Class
Nowadays I feel like watching Jab Tak Hai Jaan movie
I watched this movie on my Computer when it was new
My Earphone is damaged so I need to buy an earphone
Now I am thinking of buying a Bluetooth for me and Sweetu
You have a pair of Headphones, right, that <Sweetu> gave you on your birthday?
That's Headphones but I have to buy Bluetooth
You don't know that there is a huge difference between Bluetooth and Headphones
I wear Headphones at home but they are big so I can't take them everywhere
You may like your drama, but I don't like it
I don't like Air Conditoner air and now Summer Season is also approaching
In summer, Air Conditoner works everywhere, so you will have to live in Air Conditoner air only
My Mother doesn't know why she has pain near her navel
She told me in the morning that she has been having mild pain in the stomach from the last two four days
Right now, I am just coming back after getting my mother's medicine
Doctor was saying that my mother's stomach is slightly swollen and she needs to eat light food
Today my mother's favorite food is being prepared in our house and that is <Goitha>
When Doctor asked my Mother to eat moong dal khichdi, my Mother was surprised
Mother will not leave <Goitha> for a while, today she will definitely eat Goitha
Today, from Twelve o'clock in the noon Father's match is going to be held at <B.H.U> <I.T> Ground
The first match of the National was played between <Uttar Pradesh> and Nagaland
<Nagaland> team players were very strong and fit
In the first half of the match, <Nagaland> scored two goals and Uttar Pradesh scored one goal
The team of <Uttar Pradesh> was not that fit, hence they were not able to run
It doesn't matter, everyone played very hard from their end
After the match <Sultan> Uncle gave us two Samosas to eat
After our match, there was also a match organised for under Thirty's in <Uttar Pradesh>
The team of <Uttar Pradesh> was waiting on the field and the team of <Maharashtra> had not arrived yet
After investigation, it was found that the team of <Maharashtra> is still in the train
Due to late arrival of <Maharashtra> team, <Maharashtra> team got a walk over in the first match
Anyway, the team of <Uttar Pradesh> has been so strong that the team of <Maharashtra> would have collapsed
Today I went so far on the Bicycle that I started having a lot of pain in my knees
Now I am thinking of buying a <Scooter> after a few months because I have money shortage
But meanwhile father was asking you to buy Vehicle, so what would you say to him?
Dad needs to say something or I will borrow the money from someone
If I had wanted to borrow little money I would have taken it, but now I need around forty thousand rupees
Well, it is not necessary to buy a <Scooter>, what will you do with a Scooter?
You will just spend money by buying a Vehicle,you don't have to go everyday for study
Firstly crack N.E.T and take admission in Ph.D, then set a dream of buying a Scooter
Anyway, you dream more and work less
I know that I'm worthless, you please don't realize me again and again
My Mobile Charger is also broken and I am planning of buying a new one
Why you always beg in front of me, work hard some day
If you work hard and make money, you will understand how money comes
Whenever I see you need a Charger, a Mobile Phone, a Vehicle, what will you do with all this?
I don't know why today I don't feel like eating even a little food
Why, are you okay or has something happened to you?
Now I'm fed up with everything and tired of my life
I've never felt like this as I am feeling from last night
Feels like I have a lot of pain in my chest and a burning sensation in my heart
Hey look, now people get Heart Attack at a young age, consult and take Medicine
Today my Stomach has swelling and I am having a lot of pain
Take care of yourself because your exams are about to happen
My real exams are now going on where I am losing everything
Defeat and victory are all in the hands of God, just work with a calm mind at this time
It is not right to get angry on everything, a man should also have some patience
If not today then tomorrow everything will be fine, you just have to wait for the right time
I've been waiting for the right time for so long
When I was coming from <B.HU>, I got a call from <Shivani> on the way
<Shivani> was asking me on the phone to show my Father's match to her
By the time <Juhi> called, we had left the place
Today I also had <Iskcon> class and I could not attend the class
Twice I got a call from <Devika> Mataji but I could not pick up her call
When I came home and joined the class on the phone, it was too late
Father had gone to Station to drop Grandfather and Uncle
You know that all the people in our neighborhood have gone to <Baijnath Dham> to offer water
Before this everyone had gone to <Allahabad> to fetch water from the Sangam
Everyone had missed the train while coming from <Allahabad> and then everyone came very late
Next Sunday is <Shivratri>, do you keep fast on that day?
I have been fasting on <Shivratri> since a long time
It is believed that Mahadev married Parvati on the day of <Shivratri>
In Banaras, the festival of <Shivratri> is celebrated with great pomp and show
Just now I got a call from <Namrata> and she was crying calling me
<Namrata> has a lot of migraine problem, hence she also gets headache a lot
Yesterday he had called to take the Doctor's appointment
<Namrata> told me that sometimes a part of her body does not work due to Migraine
The Doctor has told <Namrata> that the Medicine will last for a month and after that she will undergo another C.T scan
I told <Namrata> that if you have any problems, you must let me know
<Namrata> was asking me to come to College, so I said that I will not be able to come
I think maybe she wanted to Study with me so she called me
But I don't want to study with <Namrata> so I said I won't come
Now I will study hard and live a good life
You know, I've always felt that you need to pay more attention to yourself
I still have to cook food and I am not getting how to do
First you finish your work and then cook Food
Today is Sunday and something very good must be being prepared at your house today
Today Egg Curry and Rice are being prepared in our house
Mom has prepared Rice and all we have to do is preparation of Egg Curry
Do you think that preparing Egg Curry does not take time?
Papa's favorite food is Egg Curry and Rice
My father also likes Egg Bhujia and Dal Bhaat
Well listen, when the <Match> was about to start, everyone would have clicked their photos, right?
Note down my WhatsApp number and send me all the pictures
Will there be any problem if I send it to you via Share it?
I don't have Share It app on my phone, if you have another app, let me know
Now let's send it on Whatsapp only
Photo gets torn a lot when sent on WhatsApp
If I send it to you in Document mode it won't come out torn
When I get photographs of my Father's Match, I will post it on Facebook
But I wanted my Father's team to win today's Match
I washed so many Clothes this morning that there was no space left to dry them on the terrace
Some people even call the roof Pucca and some people call it Chhatiya
I have heard many people calling the roof as Kotha
Now see, the language of every place is different and there is nothing wrong in that
In <Linguistics> we are told that language is greatly influenced by its culture and environment
Listen to the language of today's people who speak neither English nor Hindi
Now people speak mixed language which includes <English> <Hindi> <Urdu> and all other languages
I like <Braj> as the best language and after that <Awadhi>
<Banarasi> is also a very good language, I also love speaking <Banarasi>
No one calls their upbringing bad, and now this is our own language
If you hear someone speaking <Banarasi> you will feel happy from heart
If you want to hear the real <Banarasi> language or meet the real Banarasi people, then go to the Ghat
I have been speaking <Banarasi> language for so many years but I have not yet learned to speak that Ghat accent
By Two Thousand Twenty Four, <Modi's> Har Ghar Nal scheme will definitely reach our home
My Stomach is hurting so badly that I can no longer sit
But today I will take break only after composing fifteen hundred sentences
Ahh, smell of some delicious food is coming
I don't know why last night my toes were burning a lot
I always tell you not to worry so much else you'll soon get sick
Just a year ago you became ill, remember or you have forgotten?
I remember well how much I had to suffer
I will never gonna forget the year Two Thousand Twenty One if everyone had not taken me to the hospital on time then I cannot say what would had happened
Leave now and don't think about all these thoughts
All the Doctors had worsened my illness by giving me wrong medicines
Nothing happened to me at that time, only platelet countwas slightly reduced
I think everything that happens in life teaches us something
We should not be too sad in sorrow and too happy in happiness
When you remain same in every aspect of life everything will fall into place
Each day of life is passing by and we are not even realizing it
In today's weather, there are so many mosquitoes that even mosquito killer does not work
Is Mosquito Killer still lit in your house?
In our home now only water based Mosquito Killer is used
Water Mosquito Killer does not produce much smoke and does not cause any harm
In ancient times, people used to burn neem leaves to protect themselves from mosquitoes
I heard that people also used to burn egg trays to ward off mosquitoes
Highest fees are charged in <J.R.S> coaching of <Banaras>
<J.R.S> coaching is a very big name in <Banaras> hence it charges higher fees
There are many coaching courses for preparation in <Durgakund>, get yourself enrolled
After eating I can't sit and work that's why I don't feel like working
Today I will sleep after doing work and tomorrow will wake up early in the morning
Today <Shivani> was telling me that her sister's Babyshower ceremony was happened
<Shivani> got a <Ring> at the baby shower of her Aunt's daughter
His Aunt has prepared <Paneer Curry> and <Puri> and given to his home
<Shivani> will not cook food today due to arrival of food in her house
My brother doesn't like Bottle Gourd curry at all, so don't cook it today
It is said in our family that families where boys are elder they do not eat Bottle Gourd
I don't even remember when I had eaten Bottle Gourd Curry
When <Sambhar> is made with <Idli> then <Gourd> is also added to it
Yesterday <Bablu> Uncle came to stay at my house
My Father had called <Bablu> Uncle to measure the roof railing
In the entire Banaras no one does welding work better than <Bablu Uncle>
Now we need to take the entire things of ground floor to the Terrace
I have to call <Rohit> brother and order some important items from him
My Watch's Battery is dead so I don't wear it
My Mother did not eat Gourd and Wood Apple as she had stopped eating it a long time ago
It's been two days since I ate food and today I think I have got some disease
If possible, get your check up once, you will come to know everything
Now I don't even have a Health Center card, how will I get the medicine?
Come on, stop now, even <Laptop's> battery is exhausted
Tomorrow Father has to go to Rohaniya to bring the goods for the shop
I was doing my work when you are sending me message
When I respect you so much, then why do you think I don't love you at all?
When people fall into misunderstanding, it cannot be corrected no matter how hard you try
Misunderstandings are like termites, nothing can happen unless they destroy the relationship
I told you I wouldn't betray you, yet you don't trust me
The red earring which I bought from <Kashi> is lost somewhere
I can't work for too long sitting on bed
I bought a center table just for doing work
keeping Laptop on my feet and work causes aching of my legs
I think Train is not so crowded right now that you won't be able to get a ticket
Until today, I have never been on Ship, there has never been a need
My Shoes were also torn, I'm thinking to manage with slippers for a few days
My Clothes caught fire while performing rituals during last <Shivratri>
It was nice that my Mother had extinguished the fire that day, otherwise I would have been dead
The monolithic Lamp burning at the Temple of <Ramjiavan Baba> has been burning from four years
Last night I went to sleep with my phone turned on
Well I turn off my phone every night so that my phone remains fine
Today, electricity problem is there, let's see how the water gets hot for bathing in the morning
Your pillowcase is too dirty, let's wash it
I'll work a little longer and then take a bath
Today is Monday and on this day people worship Lord <Shiva>
Hey, I forgot that I had to buy brush from the shop yesterday
How will I clean my teeth today without brush?
I have a Neem Twig, may I give, will you brush with it?
In olden times, people used to brush their teeth with twigs, hence their teeth never got spoiled
Always wash Puja utensils with separate Soap
My Nivea cream is finished now so I have been using Nivea's Body Lotion from a few days
Mostly white Nivea Cream suits me and nothing else
Come with me, I'll get you cream from the Market
How many days has it been since you took a bath? In how many days do you take a bath in every winter?
No matter how cold it is, I take a bath every day
I have to do puja every day so it is very important for me to take bath every day
Okay, apply bitter oil immediately after bathing, you will not feel even a little cold
Which Oil do you apply in your hair?  Your hairs are very black
I always apply bitter oil on my hair because it does not damage my hair
How do you like <Sunsilk Shampoo>? I don't like it
Many days have passed since I went to the department of Faculty of Arts
First of all, your work will not be possibly done without going to B.H.U
You have your N.E.T exam after ten days, right?
If I sit day and night doing this work it will be done
Today for bathing I had heated the water a little
The Shop has run out of Sesame Oil used in Puja
If your Shop is run out of something else, let me know now then don't tell me later
You know <Lucky's> sister in law has gone home with all the children
All the household work has increased due to sister in law's departure to home
Now <Lucky> and <Julie> sister have to cook food
Tomorrow <Lucky> also has an exam, see how he can study
<Lucky> got exam center at <Chiraigaon> and he doesn't know the way to go there
<Lucky> was probably angry so he didn't even tell his dad anything about his center
It seems that <Lucky> will go for the exam on his own
By the way, I also once went to the center in <Chirai village>
I remember that the road to <Chirai Village> goes directly across <Baruna Pool>
If you want, you can also go there by turning on Google Map in your mobile
Well, Google Maps sometimes tells us wrong
Once we went to Cantt with the help of Google Map
Don't rely only on Google Maps or you will get lost
I am thinking of sending <Lucky> along with <Mona> to give the exam
Nowadays, there is work going on at house too, so my father is also not free
Today I finished all my work quickly and now I am free
Since I had some free time, I left home early
Do you know, this morning I reached library at ten o'clock
When I came to the library, both <Mona> and <Sweetu> had not come to the library
When I called <Mona> she said that her Father had to go to work
When I called <Sweetu> he did not answer my call
I also called at <Lucky's> landline number but no one picked it up
It looks like everyone was gone somewhere as no one picked up my phone
However, later I spoke to <Lucky> and he said he would be a little late
<Mona> will also be late today, today it feels as if I am the only one sitting free
I have to do my work today so I came early
You still have to pay two rupees to the Uncle for the Tea that you had day before yesterday, please don't forget to pay
Today when I was coming, Uncle was watching me very carefully
Is he thinking I will run away without paying his two rupees?
Let <Sweetu> come over and if I go for drinking Tea I'll pay his money
Today when I am coming, Father did not give me money, I don't know why
Usually when I came from home my Father used to give me Twenty Rupees every day
If you save your twenty rupees each day you will have save six hundred rupees per month
I also have some expenses, how can I save this money
Firstly, I have to buy vegetables in the evening with this money
I think I spend more on vegetables than I spend on myself
You are such a nice girl, who is not only taking care of herself but of her home as well
I don't understand why people take me so lightly, I'm a very hard working girl
Listen, please bring water in my water bottle, I'm feeling very thirsty
If you want, I can also bring sweets from <Bengal Sweets> along with water for you
I don't like <Sweets> so you just bring water for me
There is also <Cheer Sagar> nearby, will you eat <Dahi Bada> of there?
What happened to the <Bag> that Lucky bought for you?
Lucky's <Red bag> turned out to be very damaged so I returned it
Looks like <Julie sister> had an exam today so she left home early
Your Mother had stomach ache, how is she now?
Mom's stomach is fine now but she still has some gas problem
You know, doctors were telling me to add Alum in water while bathing
Why did Doctor tell you that?  Do you have any problem?
Doctor said that Alum does not cause any infection
I have also heard that bathing by adding camphor in the bathing water does not cause infection
To avoid infection, you can also drink alum mixed with water
Nowadays people are treating every disease with such medicines but earlier people did not do this
Earlier people used to cure every disease with home remedies only
We should not take medicine for every disease but should also adopt home remedies
Anyways, there were many sages in India who told about one after another herb
Every Tree has some Medicinal properties, you try it first
Earlier, when I used to get a wound, I used to rub Neem Oil on it and it would get cured
Once my Mother had a severe toothache and it was cured by the seeds of Bhataktaiya
If I am not able to go home this week, then I will go next week
I have tried a lot of home remedies so I am telling you all about it
When someone's Sugar rises too much, he should grind Custard Apple leaves and drink it
I like Millet Litti very much so I have ordered it from my Uncle's place
If you have Cough from many days then make a decoction of Parjata leaves and drink it
When you did not understand anything about the medicine, tell me and I will take you to <Pappu> Uncle
Whatever nature <Pappu> Uncle have but he has a lot of knowledge of home remedies
Twice he was telling us about these home remedies for an hour
<Pappu> Uncle said that if you are hungry then tell my name among your friends and eat food
The name of <Pappu Uncle> is very famous in <B.H.U>
When the <Corona period> was going on, we used to drink decoction everyday
During <Corona> we did not left the house for two years
My M.Phil was finished during <Corona>
Due to <Corona>, children's education and knowledge has deteriorated
<Corona virus> has had the biggest impact on Children's Education
During <Corona> all the children appeared on online exam and passed without studying
During M.Phil my marks were highest in the whole class but I did not got <Gold Medal>
At that time everyone had cheated me a lot
I studied very hard, thinking that I would get a <gold medal> atleast in any class
I would have got <gold medal> but I did not flatter Sir and Madam
Never mind, how can I get something which is not in my destiny?
I don't want a lot in my life, I just want satisfaction with my life
These days, there is meaningless propaganda running on T.V
I like the promotion of <Big Babol> and Fevikwik
Our T.V is not yet working because the dish wire is disturbed
My Mother is always worried about T.V
I am thinking that someday when I will be at home, I will call <Chandan Bro> and get the Dish T.V repaired
<Chandan> Bro no longer lives at his home, I don't know why
Now <Chandan> bro lives in his in laws house with his wife and child
He sometimes comes to meet his Father at his shop
When <Chandan> bhaiya comes, let me know and I will get my T.V repair from him
When Dad and I go somewhere and mom stays alone at home then she watches T.V
From few days my Mother has not been able to listen to the sermons of <Anuruddhacharya ji>
All the Bricks have been washed and now brother will do the work of fixing it and what else?
Today I came early in the morning to fill water in the terrace, so mother's work got reduced a little
Make sure you do what comes to your heart so that you can have mental peace
It's a good thing that I brought the charger for Laptop today
I think relationships should be more important than money in life
I don't know why, the work which I sent to the Aunt is unable to open on her mobile phone
Aunt called and said that she was trying to open the link from yesterday evening
After so much effort the link opens in her phone
Aunt has started doing her work from yesterday
<Raj> was telling me on the phone that together we would finish the work soon
<Shivani> do her work very slowly because she has to do a lot of work at home
I have also told <Shivani> not to worry, work only when you are free
Yesterday I suddenly had to go to <I.T> <B.H.U>
Yesterday I watched a football match in <I.T> <B.H.U>
Yesterday I came by my Vehicle because my knee has great pain
There was no oil in my Vehicle so I get filled oil of Fifty rupees
I think I will have to refill oil today, I didn't even checked if there was oil or not
I was coming today then a car driver turned the car without indicator but I was saved
I don't know why the wind was blowing so strong today that while returning by vehicle a lot of dust got into my eyes
I reached library today and went to had Tea outside
My mother gave me money today because I wanted money
I have an exam tomorrow, I am wondering how I will go, I don't even know anyone
I'm thinking of calling my Father this evening and don't know if he'll be free or not
I was thinking of going in my Vehicle but it will be night therefore I will go with my Father
I had forgot that today I have to take my admit card too
I have prepared everything but I have not taken the admit card print
I feel like I always do wrong things only
I feel like something has gone into my eyes that's why my eyes are watering
The wind is blowing very fast these days or something might have blown away
Do you know that it is month of Phagun and at this time Phagunhat is blowing
At this time, hands and feet get too much cracked due to spring wind
If you do not apply cream then there will be irritation in your hands and feet
Today I will also buy cream for myself while going home in the evening
Sometimes I feel like I'm just a burden for the whole world
I consider myself a burden so I pray to God to give me a short life
Today, potato and tomato curry was prepared at my home and I don't know why I didn't feel like eating it
Sugarcane is being peeled out at my Uncle's place
The same Sugarcane is crushed and its juice is used to make jaggery and sugar
My Father once said that a person should think first and then take a step
Before doing anything, think about what its future will be
With full dedication I have to maintain this relationship with you
I feel that there is definitely something wrong with my practice that's why you have said such a big thing today
Because of me many people are in trouble today and many people are facing problems
Today I think that if only I had not made some mistakes in my life, how much better it would have been
Manager Uncle of Canteen calls me madam of <Agra>, I don't know why
Brother <Rajesh> has given me the name Agra madam
I think my name is bit difficult to pronounce, so whoever feels like calling me by whatever name, they calls me that
I think everyone should learn from their mistakes
I learn a lot from my mistakes and everyone should learn from them
I have decided now that I will not make any mistake in any way
I should think about the future now, everyone's time and mind cannot always be the same
I will not take my Mobile to the exam tomorrow, where will I keep it?
I made Puri this morning but I didn't feel like eating it
These days, even if I make Tea, I don't feel like drinking it, now ,I am thinking of stop drinking Tea
I should quit for the sake of quitting, but I don't feel like quitting tea, that's why I am not able to quit
Everyone always tells me to stop drinking Tea but I can't stop drinking it, what should I do?
I have already reduced my intake of Tea but I am not able to give it up
I had to buy a lot of Clothes this time but now I am not buying
Tomorrow I will come early morning because I have to appear in exam too
Tomorrow I will come by <Auto> only because it will be night by the time I arrive
Now I don't understand how to explain it to you, tell me
I will not make any further mistakes, I will try not to hurt anyone
I am thinking whether I should go to <B.H.U> or not? Tell me?
I know there's a lot of work to do but I need some rest too
I have to cook food in the evening too, today I am thinking of making Kadhi Rice
I don't feel like eating but I'm thinking of preparing it
I like food cooked by my own but I don't feel like eating it
Everyday I cook food till late but I don't like it
I thought to go <B.H.U>, have a coffee and then come back to work
One wire of my earphones sometimes works and sometimes doesn't works
We must apply Tilak on our forehead everyday
I apply <Gopichandan> Tilak on my forehead everyday
By applying Tilak our mind remains concentrated and cool
<Sweetu> is asking me to go to College but I have to complete the work by tomorrow at any cost
Sorry for not being able to go with you
We are standing at such a turning point in our lives from which we do not see any way out
You pray to God that everything goes well, nothing is difficult for him
From now on you think and do work very thoughtfully
I don't do anything without thinking but I don't know how it happened
I always wanted to avoid what is happening with me today
Today, my Mother was looking at my hair and asking if I had got it cut?
I lied to my mom that my hair is wet that's why you feel like this
I got my haircut done on last Sunday by <Shammi> brother
<Shammi Brother> cut hair for free whereas if I had gone to beauty parlour it would have cost me fifty to hundred rupees
Hey, you got your hair cut in a man's salon, aren't you ashamed?
There is no shame in getting a haircut, before too I have got my hair cut in men's salons
I had short hair until eighth grade
Now I have big hair otherwise I had short hairs before
Today I was looking for the Newspaper at my house today but I couldn't find it
I had to see the news of yesterday's match in the Newspaper
I will go this evening and check whether the news is published in the newspaper or not
I don't think that I can explain anything to them now
I don't understand how to apologize, please tell me what should I do?
Now I will do any work very thoughtfully, so that no one faces any problem
I think I'm the one making the most noise in the library
What do I need to take to the exam tomorrow?  Is this given in the admit card or not?
I do work but I understand little of what I have written
I guess that's why I'm getting late in finishing work
All I know is to always think positive
Now that's why I always try to think positive
Do you know what happened today?  If yes, tell me or should I tell you?
There is a notification on my mobile that today is World Radio Day
What should I do if it's a Radio Day, should I dance?
No, on Radio Day you don't dance, just listen to the song
Do you know how to sing?  Sang a little for me, I consider you my Radio
Tell me which song will you listen to, I will definitely sing for you
Today I saw that the movie Dilwale was showing on the Telivision
You know, I used to watch a lot of movies earlier but now I don't like them so much
We need WiFi to use Internet in our Mobile
What does WiFi required means?  Why isn't it?  Because I don't have any money in my Mobile
You know I have a problem with perfume, it gives me a headache
I never apply perfume, it gives me a headache
I was supposed to wash all my clothes yesterday morning but I didn't do it
When I work, I feel concentrated, otherwise I find it very difficult
It was easier to work on Laptop as compared to Mobile Phone as there was no pain in hands and head
I guess I have to come alone tomorrow morning
Do not listen to songs at such a loud volume by wearing earphones, your eardrum will burst
My ear is not a home where curtain is there
<Simple> was saying that there were small holes in his eardrum
Don't believe much on what you heard, if you have seen it then speak to me
Why you kept such a difficult name? Whatever people understands can write it
I didn't had think that I am gonna do this much work today
But see, my work had done beyond seventeen hundred
Come on, do some other work now or will you just do one work all day and night?
<Dikshita> Madam's reminder message has also reached you
Finish doing the other thing and then put your hand on it
The work is going on very slowly otherwise I would have completed all the work on time
My work pace is not yet fixed so I am not able to work properly
The biggest reason why my work is going slow is that my neck is hurting a lot
You know, when the Raj movie is newly released, everyone was scared to watch it
What happened, there is nothing to be scared about, then why are you afraid?
I've been waiting for shovel seller to arrive for some time, right?
I have seen shovel man you come and see, you too will get scared
You don't left your Laptop in charging for so long, okay
Just put it on, not even half an hour has passed
Earlier I used to work for long hours but now I can't
You know, I threw my Mobile in anger
Hey, is the condition of your Mobile Phone fine or not? Please show me
My Mobile got broken and bent after hitting the wall
Today I planned to bring only Laptop in my bag
But then I don't know why I even kept a copy
I feel like eating Samosa today but I will not eat it
I know my stomach will hurt a lot
I know Samosa is not for me, so I am not eating it
Anyway, everyone wants to eat what they want, right?
Nowadays I think that I should apply oil on my forehead everyday
Because these days I have a headache every day
Whenever I have a headache, I always apply bitter oil on my head
Yesterday I went to the ground and I got Samosa to eat but I did not eaten it
I love listening to songs of Kumar <Sanu> and Lata Didi
I wear very tight jeans today and I'm having trouble sitting in
I have a lot of work to do but I'm wondering how to do it?
My Grandmother also considered me a little inferior, so I did not go
Only my Grandfather loves me the most and no one else
Whenever my Grandfather used to come, he used to bring <Gulab Jamun> for me
My Grandfather died when I was very young
Earlier my Uncle used to have a lot of Farms but this is not the case now
In olden times, food was cooked on earthen stoves, right?
I still love food cooked on earthen stove
Sometimes Bati Chokha was cooked on fire in our house
Sometimes on <Sunday> my Mother used to cook Bati Chokha on fire
<Ravidas> has brought a T shirt for me from the fair but it is a black T shirt
I always get calls from <Aditya> but I don't understand what to talk about
<Aditya> doesn't tell anyone but he misses his father a lot
These days I noticed that <Aditya> mutters about unknown things to himself
I thought of asking something but I am afraid of his anger
Earlier <Aditya> did not show much anger but I don't know why he is so much angry now
Call <Aditya> and tell him he has an exam tomorrow
I went to my Grandfather's house when I was very young
My Father never let me go anywhere, he always command me to study
<Aditya's> Father told him that he was very proud of him
<Aditya> always remembers this saying of his Father
Yesterday <Aditya> was asking how can I go ahead now?
<Aditya> is a very good boy but sometimes he goes crazy
<Aditya> was telling me that he had to get glasses made for himself
Because <Aditya> is having a lot of pain in his eyes and head
These days it looks like he has a lot of work to do and he uses Laptop a lot
Nowadays everyone catches cough and cold
Everyone's health is deteriorating and no one is able to do work
<Aditya> felt very cold at night but he did not cover himself, I don't know why
I still have to iron the clothes but it's already Eleven o'clock
I have to go to the library at nine in the morning and then I have to give an exam at one o'clock
I think of getting all the work done but I can't get it done
Mostly on Sundays in my house <Bhojpuri> movie plays
Tomorrow I will come home late in the evening because the exam will end at six o'clock
I was thinking of going by <Auto> for the exam but I forget the way
The thing that bothers me most is that I cannot remember my way
My house is very old and it was built when I was very young
I thought I would get a job this year but it didn't happen
My Mother gave me one thousand rupee to get the Clothes stitched
Yesterday I was going to buy Clothes but I didn't went

I also told <Lucky> to talk to the library manager and park the Vehicle there
Today, both me and my Mother are not feeling well at night
For some reason a lot of gas is forming in mom's stomach

Is your Aunt's have pea farm that she brought so many peas?
My Aunt has several acres of land where she does farming
My Aunt and Uncle from <Jhuan> are farmers
My Aunt and Uncle bring sacks of peas every year
Yesterday, the same pea curry was prepared at my house which my Uncle had brought
Village people take the same vegetables or whatever they grow in their fields to anyone's house
Shivani's house is a little ahead of <Kachwa> she was telling me
<Shivani's> sister is also getting married and she will come to pick me up
This is your <Book>, this is not my Book
If I had free time, I would have repaired my own bicycle
I was feeling very cold at night so I could not sleep
I thought I would be very bored alone today

What is there that you are playing hymns this morning?
I am planning of taking a quick bath and getting free, today is Tuesday
Is there any rule to take early bath on Tuesday?
I try to recite <Sundar Kand> on Tuesday and Saturday
You are doing great, you should have done this a long time ago
Once, many years ago, my Father asked me to recite the <Sundar Kand> on <Saturday> and <Tuesday>
I suggest that you too must have to recite <Sundar Kand>
I would even tell <Sweetu> to do some puja because it keeps the mind calm
I don't get time, what should I do?
You know that yesterday President <Draupadi Murmu> had come to our Banaras
So our Baba must have also come with President Sahiba, right?

Only to our Chief Minister <Yogi Adityanath> we call Baba

Listen, <Mona> have you brought your ration?
Mine has also not come but my Mother had gone with <Golu> Uncle to get it
I just called <Mona> and she was saying that why didn't you told me earlier?
I told her, I too didn't know anything about the same
It was good that my Mother went with Golu Chacha, otherwise we would have been left behind

The Ration Officer was saying that if possible from next month we will get wheat once and rice once
Today Bhata Kaloji was prepared at my home and it was very good to eat
My hands are not working because of carrying bricks in the morning

Father was saying today that if I get time, I have to go to buy things today
When I am coming today I don't know where my attention was , I was crushed by a <Tempu>
While coming today for the first time I did not find the gate closed so there was no traffic jam today
Yesterday when I was coming, a squirrel was crushed by someone on the way
I was thinking that I could save the life of that squirrel but I could not understand how ?
<Sweetu> was telling me that you should not come by bicycle today, come with <Mona>
I later came to know that <Mona> had already left the house
Even if I had known, I would have come with <Mona>
Don't know why but I don't want to be with others anymore
<Mona> is your friend, right?  Then why are you saying this about her?
You have come here to study or to sleep, whenever I look I found you sleepy only
My health is not fine, my eyes are hurting a lot
Today time is moving very fast, I don't understand, why?
It's summer now, isn't it?  The days should be longer now, but they seem to be getting shorter
Hey, the day is not short or long, in my opinion morning and evening happens soon
In winter, God Sun rises after eight o'clock and by four o'clock the sun sets
In the present time evening happens around six o'clock and in winter around three four o'clock
Today there is water on the roof and floor too hence it is late
In Winter I reach home by four o'clock and in Summer upto five o'clock I stay here only
Yesterday I was late to leave so my Mother was very angry with me
Yesterday I went to watch the match at <I.T ground> so I was late
Then while going home due to gate being closed there was a Traffic jam
Today I'm planning to talk to him but he doesn't have time
Today I was not feeling well even at my home so I did not do any work
I don't even remember to come, I have collected my exam admit card from library this morning itself
I have to leave the library at one o'clock, only then I will be able to reach there by three o'clock
After the exam is over, I have to come to the library by seven o'clock and take my vehicle
They were asking me where my exam was and where my center is ?
He came with me till Naria and visited <B.H.U>
You know I didn't iron my clothes at night so I came wearing dirty clothes
I've been wearing this shirt from a week and it's gotten very dirty
Today when my exams are over I will do my work
I have to go to my village tomorrow because there is a wedding in my village tomorrow
I have no money in my mobile so I can't text you
I also want to ask you, where is your village?
My village is in <Ramnagar> but I have been living here since the beginning
I was born here too, I have never lived in my village
Many people of my village do not recognize me and I never want to go there
<Aditya> told me that he was not going to appear in the exam, but I said him, no you should go and appear in your exam
I don't understand why two pages are given in the admit card?
<Mona> texted me that her Laptop is not supporting wifi
On the night news I saw the President worshiping in the Temple
I feel great in Library now earlier I didn't like the Library
Cold breeze has been blowing since day before yesterday so my feets have lots of pain
There were a lot of mosquitoes biting in my room at night, today I will lit good night
I am thinking that it would be good if I get a vehicle everyday for a few days
The wind has been blowing very cold since this morning, I have taken a bath with hot water
My Mother was saying that the electricity bill is very high these days
Today I want a good sleep but I am not feeling sleepy
Every morning we put the garbage bucket outside before the garbage truck arrives
I was very thirsty yesterday but couldn't find water anywhere
I think, I'll do some work and then go out, I have to go at one o'clock
I can't sleep without turning off the lights, so it's dark
I feel like I won't get food today?  I'm very hungry
From tomorrow, you can have food at my house, okay?
Ohh okay, from tomorrow I will come to your house to have food
I genuinely feel like eating Paneer curry
I had prepared paneer curry on <Saturday> only but I did not had eaten it
I don't know why I don't feel like going anywhere
I just love being alone and don't feel like going anywhere
As I am working so still I am typing with lot of mistakes
I also love raw Paneer so I thought of eating it
I want to change my mobile number on my Aadhar Card, will do it after the exams are over
I will not go to College today, I will go to the Library everyday now
I can't do even a little work in College, it's so noisy there
There are no vacant classes or places available in the College
Whenever I go to College I have to do work sitting at the Canteen only
The College is very near to the home but the Library is very far
The bitch of our Library is very beautiful
She is white in color and looks exactly like <Tuffy> from movie Hum Aapke Hain Koun
When I come in the morning she is the first one to come running to me
I think <Sweetu> will be very hungry by evening
I am too crazy, I later remembered that I have to bring tiffin for <Sweetu>
Now I'm thinking of finishing my two thousand sentences quickly
I had not yet completed one task and <Sandhya> sister gave me another task
Now I have to start my second task from tomorrow onwards
From tomorrow I will spend less time on this project and more time on my studies
Yesterday evening I got a call from <Rimjhim> and I enjoyed talking to her
How good it feels when someone understands the reason behind your sadness without your telling to them
After talking to <Rimjhim> I felt how wonderful it would be if she were my sister
Anyway, my relationship with <Rimjhim> is that of both a good friend and a sister
In Two Thousand Twenty One, I met many people with whom I have no personal relation, but they are more important to me than my own people
Sometimes I think how lucky I am to have such caring people in my life
Sisters like <Rimjhim> and <Shivani> should be there in everyone's life
I have two meetings this evening, one from Eight o'clock and the other at Eight Thirty
It is very important for me to attend the Eight p.m. meeting because today I have to give a presentation there
I will tell <Devika> Mataji that I will attend the second meeting by quarter to nine instead of Eight Thirty p.m
Today in the second meeting <Soumya> mataji scolded me alot
Yesterday I told all the devotees of Iskcon that classes will start from today
But classes had been started from yesterday and everyone missed one class
As I was telling you, I remembered that I had to ask <Devika> Mataji to include everyone in the group
Today I feel like going to watch the match again but whom should I go with?
Today is the final match of <Uttar Pradesh>, let's see with whom it is
Look, if I'm done with my work, I'll take <Mona> to watch the match
Yesterday our team won despite losing
I'm out of water and now wondering how to order it?
It is Aarti's job to bring water but <Aarti> no longer comes to meet me
Aarti is paying a lot of attention to her studies these days
Sometimes I feel like asking her to meet me but I won't gonna ask her
Yesterday I met football coach <Bhairav> sir
A man should be simple and ordinary like <Bhairav> sir
I have been going to the ground from so many days but unable to saw <Vinod> sir there
<Kapri Sir> was also supposed to play in yesterday's match but he did not play
In my opinion all matches should end today or tomorrow
Father said he would be at the gate by one o'clock, I don't know why he is late
<Sweetu> is waiting there at the gate and doesn't have any news about Father
Don't worry, Father will drop him on time
Father is more worried about <Sweetu's> departure than you
Sweetu has to buy a small bottle of water from the tea seller's place
In hurry Sweetu forgot to carry water bottle
I told <Mona> that it is only available at worth five rupees
Now you just see that in the evening <Mona> will send her Mother to bring sevda from my shop
I don't know why when she has to buy something, <Mona> doesn't come herself and instead sends her mother
Maybe she has some problem that's why she is not coming
Sitting with dangling legs immediately causes legs pain
Today let's go to eat Samosa from <Bhailal> Uncle's place
Earlier, at <Bhailal> Uncle's place, Samosa was available for six rupees

Let us know your feedback by sending this sentence for a <test>
Some sentences from Mai or Ahirani <article> can be taken here
This article is taken from Ahiranichya Nimittane Bhasha <Book>
The author of this book is Dr. <Sudhir Deore>
My mother tongue is Ahirani and <Marathi> is my language of education
My Father was a Teacher in <Primary School> but whenever he came home he used to talk to us in Ahirani
Since my childhood I have no inferiority complex towards my mother tongue <Ahirani>
Today all my siblings are <Teachers>
Even if there is an elderly person with them or me we speak <Ahirani> only among ourselves
Our <conversation> will not be polite without speaking in Ahirani
We know from within that <dialogue> between us will not be complete
But my daughter's mother tongue is not Ahirani
My daughter's mother tongue is <Marathi>
This does not mean that <girl> does not understand Ahirani
There are many people in this Ahirani region whose <mother tongue> is not Ahirani
People here speak <Ahirani> in a very simple way
People here do <business> in Ahirani language
There are many examples of everyday work being done in a <foreign language> despite the mother tongue being different
Mother tongue can be different, the language of communication can be different, the <language of education> can also be different
To avoid all this confusion, it would be appropriate to define <mother tongue>
The language which the mother speaks to the child, the child's first response to the mother is in that language, that is the child's <mother tongue>
According to the definition of mother tongue, <Ahirani> is my mother tongue
It is clear that my daughter's <mother tongue> is Marathi
If my mother tells my daughter in <Ahirani>, she understands
The daughter comes to me and communicates with me in <Marathi>
She does not realize that the girl has <translated> from Ahirani
The girl has the ability to <translate> from Ahirani to Marathi
The child can learn many <languages> at an early age
This is why even a rural Ahirani native speaker translates a <message> in Marathi into actual Ahirani without understanding
Information should be filled correctly in <census>, <application> or any other application
People get confused in front of Ahirani mother tongue <word issue>
In census they write Marathi as their education language is <Marathi>, but their mother tongue is Ahirani
As their <educational language> is Marathi, they do all their work in Marathi today
His mother tongue is Ahirani because his language is Ahirani since <childhood>
Although, whatever his <mother tongue> is should be written in front of the column of mother tongue
People have been immersed in tradition under the influence of <folk arts>
In childhood, Ahirani culture was prevalent everywhere in our village <Virgaon>
Today <Ahirani culture> has been corrupted
In childhood, there were different experiences everywhere even outside the <School>
Market, Shops, Lanes were our free <Schools>
I was very interested in <folk arts> in childhood
Rural world had the power to <hypnotize>
I used to follow all kinds of <Ahirani folk songs>
When I was in second and third standard I once sung folk songs in front of my <Class Teacher>
I used to sing in the class on the request of a <Teacher>
<Female> said, now <Fifteenth August> is near, you have to sing this song on that day
On Fifteenth August, the Teacher made my friend named Dattu wear a <Saree>
All the Children of <Marathi School>, Children of Middle School, fifteen Teachers of both the Schools, some Villagers were sitting in front
I was at the <door> of the School and next to me was standing a boy named Dattu wearing a Saree
<Dattu> was much taller than me
I started <singing>
Since the song was humorous, there were lots of <laughs> from the front
It became famous in the whole <village> that I could sing very well.
In my childhood, whenever a <girl> got married in the village, I would sing on the mike
In those days of my childhood, I made many <young men and women> dumb by singing
Hiding your mother tongue is <ridiculous>
In my childhood, we came in contact with <Marathi> only when we talked to our school teachers
While talking to friends in <School>, we always spoke in Ahirani
Ahirani was our <natural mother tongue>
Some Teachers were from our area <Ahirani locality>
The Teachers spoke to each other in <Ahirani language>
Before studying <linguistics>, I never felt inferior about speaking Ahirani
There was never any case of <inferiority complex> in my mind towards the language

She used to talk to the Teacher in Ahirani language, which <Teacher> did not like
Our <Teacher's> wife used to cook good food
The Teacher's wife was illiterate and the Teacher did not like this
This increased <inferiority complex> in the Teacher's wife
She could speak <Marathi> with great difficulty
How to speak in Ahirani in front of everyone? This <question> was always before her
She was trying her best to speak <Marathi> out of inferiority complex
Of course, she became a laughing stock all the time because of the <mixed language>
A natural language is always called <Natural Language>
The distance between Virgaon and Satana is just <Ten kilometers>
When we were in school, hardly anyone would go to <Satana>
Communication was not very <wide>
They would also come from <Satana> to watch movies
After watching <cinema>, during school holidays, they would narrate the story to all their friends
The pleasure of listening to the story of the cinema was <double>
Even at that time the story of <cinema> was called a story
One of our friends named Kalu once came back from <Satana> after watching a movie
During the recess, <Kalu> was telling us a story on the ground
When we reached there, his <story> had already begun
<Kalu> then started telling us the story from the beginning
Meanwhile, someone asked, which <cinema> did you watch?
<Kalu> immediately said, <Chitra>
All the children laughed after hearing Kalu's answer
<Chitra> was the name of a Theatre in <Satana>, not a Cinema
One said, keep quiet, tell me <Kalu>
Such was <Kalu> the story of Hindi cinema
His eyes were shining while narrating the story of <cinema>
He had no problem with <language>
Everyone speaks in one <language> to communicate
The same <language> varies from person to person
No matter which <language> one speaks, he speaks in his own language
We hear the same <language> in different ways
Some speak <natural language>, some speak artificial language
Some people speak <polite language>
<Kalu's> language was only a natural language
Even today <Kalu> is in our village in Veergaon
<Kalu> works hard in the fields day and night
<Kalu> keeps speaking the same natural <Ahirani language>
Saraswati always dances on <Kalu's> tongue
<Kalu> was telling the story in real Ahirani
We were laughing at every sentence of <Kalu> holding our stomach
He was telling the story of Hindi cinema in a beautiful <Ahirani language>
The entire movie was being told by <Kalu> in his own language
He was also translating the emotions in <cinema> into Ahirani language
<Kalu> also demonstrated how abuses in Ahirani language can be given in Hindi
<Kalu> had no idea that we were translating something very important
Even the listeners with <Kalu> had no idea that how big a job they were doing while talking about the language
Even at such a young age, my <eyes lit up> on seeing the maintenance of Ahirani
Due to the <diversity> of words in the language, many relevant jokes were created
Everyone at home had the habit of speaking <Ahirani>
Used to talk to <friends> in Ahirani, with shopkeepers in Ahirani,  in business also in Ahirani
In the School, till the <Teacher> came, we Children used to keep talking to each other
During the conversation with <Teachers>, there used to be relevant laughter and jokes in between
Once <Teacher> asked, have you brought the essay copy?
Language related problems are always seen in the Primary, <Secondary Schools> here
Along with the Teachers, <Parents> also look at the funny things in the language with laughter
A language conscious practitioner needs to take the language <seriously>
Language study should be included in school <Curriculum>
<Students> take the language seriously
Language can help in reduce <humor>
In other dialects of <Marathi>, the word <maai> is used to address mother
<Maai> This word is used to make fun in Ahirani
Once an <English Teacher> was teaching in our class
The teacher noticed that a student named <Devman> was not paying attention to the Teacher
The teacher said to <Devman>, <Devman> stand up
<Teacher> said, tell me, what is the meaning of <maai>?
Without a moment's delay, <Devman> said, mother
Even if a word with the same letter occurs in two different <languages>, it confuses the students
The politeness of <purity> is not brought in the language
Around <Jalgaon> it is called shevaya
A <Teacher> scolded a boy of my class for using this word
An <Art Teacher> sometimes asked the Children, what did you eat?
<Teacher> used to ask in the class so the Students used to tell
No one was bothered by answering in <Ahirani language>
Sometimes a <Teacher> deliberately adopts a stubborn attitude
A <Teacher> used to say, you speak impurely like a donkey, learn to speak clearly
Even at that time I did not like such behavior of <Teachers>
But still today the teachers were picking up the students in a <violent> way
If this story had stopped here, I would not have <remembered> it today
They did not even think that teasing anyone is <cruelty>
Once there was a lecture on <Marathi language>, criticism and prestige
In childhood, our language of conversation was completely <Ahirani>
There was pressure on my mind because I had to talk to Teachers in <Marathi language> in School
It was getting firmly established that Marathi should be an effective and <prestigious language>
Some contemporary reasons also played an important role in creating the equation of <prestigious language>
The person who had just got married in village his <daughter in law> was from the city
A <Marathi speaking> woman or young girl was considered arrogant
In <Virgaon>, criticism of Marathi speaking women was heard
<Marathi speaking> woman or young girl was considered arrogant
A Marathi speaking woman was a topic of discussion among other <women>
However, similar experience was there in case of <men> as well, but the edge of that criticism was a little blunt
Although criticized by peers, to some extent a friend was also worthy of <praise>
A Marathi speaking youth was especially praised by <women>
From time to time, a lot of <conversations> were heard
Due to some such experiences, the society of that time looked at the Marathi language with <respect> and also with inferiority
They had <respectful> curiosity towards Marathi
The society of that time also criticized those who abandoned the language we traditionally speak due to <illiteracy>, friends lacked the ability to make accurate decisions and choices
There was confusion in the minds of <Children> about the language
Since the language of Education was Marathi, there was no <resentment> towards it
Due to confusion and lack of decision making in the society of that time, <language was inferior>
<Bilingual> understanding was seen everywhere
Even the imposed <language> was tolerated here and there
As <Marathi> was considered as a prestigious language, the case with Hindi was the opposite
There were two three <Muslim families> in our village
The <financial condition> of the Muslim families was very bad
Actually, the economic condition of the entire village was like a <torn sky>
Our <condition> was worse than others
It got stuck in my mind that people who speak <Hindi> are bad
There was not that much <sweetness> in Hindi in our village
This language, which sounded very <bad> to the ears, did not seem like our own
There was no elegance and <beauty> in Hindi
Somewhere I had this unconscious understanding that Hindi is a <dalbhadhri language>
I had a feeling of <irritation> towards Hindi
I had noted in my notebook that Hindi cannot be a language of <prestige>
An Ahirani man spoke even better <Hindi> than a Hindi speaker
Speaking in Hindi was not only funny but also <disgusting> to me
An Ahirani speaker spokes in broken <Hindi> to a Hindi speaker
I had a friend named <Riyaz> <Pathan> in School
Mitra had mingled with us so much that he spoke <Ahirani>
While talking to family members at home, his <Hindi> had deteriorated because of us
Mitra spoke Ahirani Hindi <mixed language>
Once he had told us, my Hindi has now become <a laughing stock> even in our house
The equation of Marathi being prestigious and Hindi being trivial was forming <strongly> in my mind
Otherwise, <Hindi> was the only subject taught in school
Due to such practical experiences of <Hindi>, I lost interest in Hindi
My understanding of Hindi was against <linguistics>
I had no <complaints> with any other language
After Tenth, I was selected for H.A.L <Technical Instructor> in Tools
Our training manager was a Sikh gentleman named <Parmar>
All Hindustani people are employed in <Hindustan Aeronautics Limited> the Mig aircraft factory
There is no harm in saying that <H.A.L> is a short form of the whole of India
<H.A.L> means a small replica of India
I had been at <work> for only five or six days
I had not yet come across Parmar's <actual speech>
I wanted a day off and for this I went to <Parmar's> office
To speak to the training manager, I prepared what to say in the core <Marathi>
As I approached the <cabin>, I said, May I come in? Sir
I said as if I was reading the words printed in pure Marathi sir, I have an urgent work in my village so tomorrow I want a day's <leave>
Parmar frowned and said, What?
Is <Parmar> upset because I am asking for a day off?
I again started saying the same repeated sentence in <Marathi>
<Parmar> interrupted me and said, what are you talking about?
A gentleman was sitting on a chair in front of <Parmar>
A man sitting in front <intervened>
He looked at me <sympathetically> because I could not speak Hindi
He played the role of interpreter by translating my word <parmaran> into Hindi
Parmarji sighed with an expression on his face that this is a very <minor> matter
A drawer of the <Table> was opened and a blank C.L form was given to me
Write this and <sign> it, said Parmar and got busy with his work
Leaving the daily Ahirani despite speaking in such pure <Marathi> we were ignored
I was very <disturbed> at that time
With many such <experiences> my inferiority complex towards the Hindi language gradually disappeared
From Ahirani I crossed the middle stage of <Marathi> and started jumping straight to the stage of Hindi
I have started using Ahirani in my <shayari>
I write poetry in <Marathi> along with Ahirani
My Ahirani poetry collection <Aadim Taalnam Sangeet> has one hundred and fifty three poems
Even in my <Marathi Poem>, some specific words of Ahirani have been deliberately used
Such words have also been used in some poems of the Marathi poetry compilation <Dankh Vyalaylam Kesha>
The <Editor> of the magazine, readers also want to know the meaning of the words
After reading the poem <Kavitaarti>, Shankar Ramani asked the meaning of the word <Tarangghani> through a letter
No word is used merely as an <insult> or to obscure the poem
It is used to make the poem meaningful and the words in Ahirani are used in the hope of becoming a <model> in Marathi
Recently I have deliberately used the Ahirani word <Dhubbhe> two or three times in the poem
My present living area Satanya is being newly <developed>
The village does not have <paved roads>
There is <black> cultivable soil
During monsoon time it becomes very difficult to walk on the unpaved roads
When the soil dries up, two deep pits are formed on the road due to the movement of <vehicles> and tractors
<Wet soil> swells up in the middle of the road and form mounds
The elevated part of the road is called <dhubb> in Ahirani
Actually, the word <dhubb> brings the exact picture of height before the eyes
One of my professor friend made fun of me because I used the word <dhubb> once in a sentence
The language itself has many <stories> which are worth telling
It was late <night> to reach home after some event
An elderly friend of mine came to drop me home in his <Fiat> car
One day my <professor friend> was also there
In Mitra College, <Marathi literature> is also taught along with linguistics
Still, when I used some such Ahirani words on <road>, they laughed
Whenever they get a chance, they also <joke> about me on this word
Since the bad experience I have deliberately started using the Ahirani word <dhubam> in poetry
Another friend who speaks Ahirani asked me a <question> a few days ago
His friend's doubt showed more <decency> than knowledge
I don't have much relation with <Ahirani>, we speak only Marathi at home this is also an arrogance in his speech
My friend probably doesn't understand Marathi well, so I explained to him in <English>
He said to his <friend>, can you tell me an Ahirani sentence with that word
My brother in law calls his <mother> as Maadi, said the friend
The friend was an <Ahirani> speaker but considered Ahirani to be an inferior language
<Dialect> and Vulgarity may be closely related
Though <vulgarity> in dialect is not inevitable, it may be an integral part
Dialect patterns from <Urban> areas to underdeveloped remote areas should be examined
<Vulgarity> is more prevalent in the language used in rural areas than in urban areas
Though vulgarity may be offensive to our <civilian> ears, it is not so in underdeveloped areas
They <casually> mention gender related words in front of everyone as if they were common names
Vulgar references come easily in <rural language>
Everyone's ears will perk up, <decency> will be violated
Nobody had anything to do with <abuse>
The <woman> who is called bad words will also not care much
This bad word is <condemnation> of your wrongdoing, that is what it means and it works
With usage, such <vulgar references> have become blunt and smooth in the dialect
There is no novelty in <rural abuses>
<Abuses> are used easily without thinking like a common words
An Ahirani woman from a rural area easily <abuses> her own daughter
She does not even feel her <insult> in any street
In fact, <abuse> becomes a redeeming feature of her own character, yet the abuse is blunt
Abuse considered obscene in <civilian language> is found in large numbers in the dialect
In my article titled <bar>, I have quoted such obscene abuses in the Ahirani folk tradition, the obscene words of abuses have not been replaced with a wrong sign
What we call <obscenity> is extremely secondary and also indispensable in the eyes of the villagers
Just as there is nothing pure and impure in <language>, similarly there is nothing indecent and obscene in language
A language is just a <language>
While urban language is spoken indirectly through symbolic images, <dialect> is spoken directly
Language cannot be accused of obscenity because it contains <insult> of language
We have become accustomed to calling anything <obscene>
We try to bring <naturalness> in language
As soon as we see obscenity, we criticize, fight it and work to make it <forbidden>
As soon as we feel that this cannot be done with <elders>, we try to correct it
If this has happened with the abhang of <Saint Tukaram>, then what will happen to people like you and me?
The word <kaasechi> is interpolated in the abhang of <Tukaram>
We also consider <saints> vulgar and indecent and try to correct their poetry
We read and write only that which we can <digest> and correct that which we cannot digest
If this is happening with <Saints>, then what will happen to the good or bad literature written by us?
No matter how much we identify any border issue in linguistic harmony, there is no <truth> in it in the eyes of the people
People of any <border region> know two languages
Ahirani speaking person can also learn Marathi, Hindi and <Gujarati> easily
Ahirani is connected to <three languages>
Many <Gujarati words> are found in Ahirani
Hindi and Marathi are the languages ​​of <education> in this region
While going to <Dharwad> in the bus, two men from Belgaum sat in front of me
Unbeknownst to them, one spoke Marathi to the other while the other spoke <Kannada> to the first
Their <communication> was not interrupted anywhere
Both should know each other's <language>
One Marathi speaking person had a daily newspaper <Maharashtra Times> while one <Kannada> person had a daily newspaper in Kannada
They both exchanged papers after reading and sometimes they read paper speaking <Marathi> <Kannada>
This <linguistic scene> got imprinted on my mind
<Boundary question> is no longer a question of intimacy or identity in my case
A language picture appears in the form of <Marathi Hindi> on the <Madhya Pradesh> border
This <linguistic harmony> should be everywhere
<Two languages> are spoken in the border areas of each state
For <Political purposes> the question which is not ours is propagated as a question in <border areas> people
People in <border areas> will surely have some questions, not to say that it's all white, linguistic injustice should also be tolerated to some extent
Bilingual status in border areas is a boon if linguistic cordiality is shown <generosity> from both sides
Speakers should <respect> both languages
If languages ​​are to be preserved, we have to <treat> languages ​​with respect
Many <dialects> were spoken in India
Many languages ​​have died in <India>
Today, eighteen hundred <dialects> are found spoken and countable in India
It is unfortunately a true statement that the languages ​​which are alive are not alive because of the educated but because of the <illiterates>
Behind the survival of Ahirani are also <illiterates>
All dialects are rich in <Oral Folklore>
Folk literature is vanishing day by day due to the laziness or inferiority complex of <educated>Ahirani has a vast oral folklore tradition alive, some have become extinct
A small amount of <Folk Literature> has been collected
Whatever <folk literature> is left today is due to the folk traditions of remote areas
This note is important not only in respect of Ahirani and other dialects, but the same can be said about <Marathi>
Ahirani and Marathi are also still alive due to <illiterate> people in the villages
If someone thinks that the Marathi language is alive today because of <universities>, then he is wrong
To keep <Marathi> alive, the Marathi dialects have to survive
The <folk literature> and folk art of the language must be kept alive
Modesty should not be followed in terms of language <obscenity>
If standard languages ​​are to be kept alive, then <dialects> have to be kept alive
No matter how much effort one makes to acquire a language, words come from <speech> only
At a certain point of <excitement> our mother tongue comes to the tongue involuntarily
Whether you want it or not, <mother tongue> will emerge
It is important to preserve your <mother tongue> instead of hating it
One can love his own language without hating any <other language>
There is no such thing as impure or pure or <obscene> in a language
Language is only for <speaking>
Language exists for <conversation>, not for argument
Then I was in <seventh> class
<Marathi Teacher> read each part of that text and watched the reaction on our faces
<Teacher> expected us to laugh and react to whatever the author was commenting
<Teacher> was upset because we were not getting any reaction
<Teacher> said in frustration, do you understand the joke or not? Not even a nerve on your face moves
Oh, this is <humorous language>, you know?
As genuine as our <Teacher's> frustration was, the particular word was creating difficulty
Undoubtedly, our <difficulty> was in not appreciating the humor
After the <Onions> are harvested from the field, they are stored well in a sieve before being taken to the market
The structure of this slum is like that of a <rural hut> and it is much longer than the hut
Both sides have slopes like a <hut> and sugarcanes are spread on top
During the rains care is taken that water does not fall on the <onions>
Kawadis, plates made of <cotton> stalks are placed all around
One tray arrangement is made to make it open
No matter how poor the <farmer> of the village is, he will not go to live in a house like this slum
<Farmer> has a separate house in the village or farm to live in
In the slum we did not feel anything like laughter or <joke>
We were surprised, as described in the chapter, the <social>, economic conditions of these characters are good
All this mess was happening because <Teachers> did not do it
I remembered my confusion while teaching <alphabet>
The urban approach of <Teaching Alphabet> is imposed on rural children
Rural Children suffer academic loss due to <Urban Curriculum>
If we do not talk with understanding in <studies>, then it creates confusion in the minds of children
<Pineapple>, the fruit of Konkan, is found everywhere
Thirty years ago, this fruit was not found in <Virgaon> of Baglan division
We had to learn to say Annannas from A in <School>
Even the elders could not tell what <pineapple> is and how it looks
<Teachers> were also not resolving such doubts
There was a lot of fear of <teachers> in rural areas
Even students studying in <tenth class> used to avoid asking questions
It is better to <imagine> the children of first class
Those things should be taught in <rural and urban areas> like fruits, food items, grains, animals, birds which are known everywhere
<Textbooks> should be prepared by considering many things from all sides
When we were in the first <class>, this did not happen, so we could not learn properly
In <book>, the names of objects should be given in such a way that they can be understood everywhere
It is very important to consider children's understanding in <education>
If <children> are taught with understanding, then primary education becomes easy
It should be seen how <students> will develop an interest in learning
Some recent guide <manuscripts> seem to use words in place of original heavy words
Thirty years ago there was no <alternative situation>
Children of our generation studying in <primary school> are very spoiled, the situation of primary school children of our generation is even worse
There are many examples of the same thing as <Pineapple>
Due to being small, many things were not even visible to us
During studies, we had to quench the thirst of milk with <buttermilk>
If today's <rural, tribal children> are to be educated with passion, then some aspects are important
It should be started with <everyday> familiar objects and their language
We can be successful in <educating> the children
Is linguistic politics possible in <Maharashtra>?
<Symposium> has been organized on linguistic topics in the conference
I did not understand the topic of <Symposium> properly
What exactly does <language politics of a Marathi person> mean?
Mostly Marathi people do politics in <Maharashtra>
Is an attempt being made to give a different color to the word <politics>?
The nature of this project is a network for the protection and preservation of <Marathi language>, society and culture
<The entire <India> including Maharashtra> is a society full of different castes
Castes alone do not mean that there is diversity in <folk culture>
Feelings of <superiority> and inferiority are mainly reinforced by castes
Firstly <caste> and then sub caste provinces have blocked collective progress
There have also been castewise or provincewise <Maharashtra> linguistic differences
Dialect, <sublanguage>, pronunciation differences are seen from a regional or casteism perspective
Day by day <conversation> between them is diminishing
<Feminism> is prevalent, economically superior lower classes have been created by caste feminism
Caste equations are decisive in job based politics in <Maharashtra>
From time to time, the tendency of group, tribe, herd will be raised in the awakened <law>
The division of society keeps happening <indirectly>, with state patronage or silent consent
<Caste Society> also gets confused and artificial inequality increases
It is considered natural by the teachings of traditions passed on <generation after generation>
<Imaginary Religion> has recently raised its head
Politicians are using <religiosity> as a currency
People who were called tolerant for years were insulted using <abusive language>
Cowardly people who were afraid of <rats> started rioting easily
In which <century> we are in, twenty first or fifteenth?
Suspicious questions on all sides <blurred> the atmosphere
Anyone living in <Maharashtra> is a Marathi
A person who behaves like Marathi people, speaks Marathi, is a <Marathi> person, right?
A person should be recognized as a <human being>, not as a person from a particular religion, foreigner or minority
What's the point if we have the same evil eye for asking votes in <elections>?
Do we have a <psychopathic mindset>?
?In fact, all Marathi people are right here in <Maharashtra>
These <languages> are looked upon with hatred towards other languages ​​
<Languages> are treated with suspicion and contempt
<Caste> and provincial differences should not be intensified
In fact, the attitude of finding <impurities> in language comes from the source of ignorance
When our love for <language> does not turn into hatred for any other language, then the attitude starts getting corrected
<Language lover> should understand this
After reading my issue of Ahirani <Dhol>, I received a letter from Madhav Kondavilkar
In the <letter>, he had said that because of dialects, people identify us as a special caste
He was insistent on <standard language> because he had to face many difficulties
If he had got encouraging experience from <Marathi> people, how wonderful it would have been today
<Kondavilkar> must have contributed a lot to that special language
In short, all this is <Marathi mentality>
To change this mindset, the cure is more <dangerous> than the disease
All dialects and their <cultural diversity> cannot be eliminated
Diversity should be welcomed with the belief that it will not only destroy <Marathi culture>
Your <dialects> and sub languages ​​should not disappear
It should be seen whether <Marathi> can be enriched by choosing good things from the language
An Ahirani speaking person will remain a <Marathi person> and a Konkani speaking person will also remain a Marathi person
Anyone living in <Maharashtra> will first remain a Marathi person
<Christians>, Parsis, Muslims in Maharashtra are also Marathi
About three and a half hundred years ago <Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj> created a broad politics of Marathi people
<Vaibhavi> today it was very cold in Nashik, so it was impossible to leave the house
<Lalita> two thousand players from India participated in the National Sports and Competition held in Varanasi
<Manisha> everyone should note that Anganwadis have started in many places in Adarsh ​​Nagar area of ​​Delhi
<Rajesh> It is great to acquire the art of dance, however it can be achieved through practice

<Rajesh> There is a different joy in roaming outside and especially visiting beautiful tourist places
<Lalitha> this is equally true that an artist brings a change in society through his art
<Ajay> there are people in everyone's life who influence them
<Lalitha> life is happy if the neighbours are good, otherwise nothing is good
<Amol's> Children likes to go to school every day, because there they get to learn new things
<Joseph> a few days before Christmas, various programs have started in the church
<Pandharinath> eating does not mean taking everything in one plate
<Shailendra> there is a very big hill next to Ahmednagar
<Shaila> It has become necessary to add cinnamon and other spices in the vegetables
<Anuradha>, Farmers rear cows and goats in the fields
<Sachin> Winter in Kashmir is a different experience
<Ashwini> curry can be made by mixing gram flour
<Aryan> eating biscuits with tea is a different kind of pleasure
<Mahesh> It has become difficult to walk on the left side of the road
<Shraddha> glass utensils should always be wiped with a clean cloth
<Karuna> Plant trees, save trees is always the slogan

Shop people gave us a very good discount to <jewellery> that we bought
The shop people gave visiting card to my <elder sister> and said to come again
In this shop, everyone is talking nicely and showing <jewellery>
We kept all the <jewellery> safely and left carefully
It was already late night and soon we went to the <bus> stop
Sitting in the <bus> immediately, we came to my <elder sister> home
I got up in the morning and climbed the <bus> and came to my house
So my <sister> and I went shopping together and it felt very good
It is understood that all things will be known only if we go and visit sometimes to <Vijayawada>

My <sister> had a mehandi in her hands so I made her drink juice
As soon as we go home, our <elder mother> served us rice, we ate and slept
Our <sisters> arrived from the town in the evening
We all talked happily and got <Biryani> and ate it
We have packed the return gifts which will be given to the <hundred> people who come for engagement
Then we all got ready by getting up at <five o'clock> itself in the morning
I made hair style of my <elder sister> that's why my hand has pain
Even so, I worked hard and put braid to my <sister>
We went to hall in the car as soon as my <elder sister> got ready
Everything kept ready by the time me and my <elder sister> go there

Our <sister> is also looking very happy then the couple exchanged the garlands and sat
When the garlands were exchanged, everyone blessed and I took around <Thirty> photoes
After all that, we too had lunch and left to <home>

Along with me, <two> others also started coming for <walking>
They are more excited than me
I also started <walking> by competing with them
Since then daily we have been going for <walking>
Everyone says there are many benefits of doing <walking> like this
Body will be strong even if you make some yoga impressions with <walking>
It will be difficult to do Yoga and <walking> as I have exams
As the tests were near, I started waking up at <three'o clock> in the morning daily
I used to wake up early in the <morning> and walk for an hour
I used to drink <Green Tea> while coming home
Shortly after drinking <Green Tea>, my <Mother> made Tiffin ready for me
I used to sleep like that for a while by closing eyes after I ate <Dosa>
After I get up I go to my <room> and start studying
And then I used to come down in the afternoon to eat <Rice>
After re reading and taking a bath in evening, again I used to roam for <ten> minutes
Then at <six o'clock> in the Evening he eats Rice and goes to sleep
The whole <ten> days of exams were spent like this
As I stayed <ten> days at home it felt very boring
One day I asked <Mom> let's go out
Our <Mom> told me, okay let's go
The next day we have gone <Tenali> to do <shopping>
Once went into the <Tenali> <Market> my eyes were sparkled
There are <many> types of shops bustling with new <clothes>
My <mom> and me stopeed at a <shop> by walking forward
If you see it is <saree> shop me and my <mom> went into it

It took a lot of time to arrive <Dosa> but it is very nice
A very hungry me quickly started eating <Dosa>
My <Mom> ordered another <Dosa> for me while eating the <one>
But  I could not eat <second> one I gave it to my <mom> itself to eat
Then we came out after eating <Dosa> and searcing for <Clothes> shop
As my <Mom> purchased Sarees, now it is my time to purchase

Shop is all over filled with  <a hundred> people and everyone is too busy
Me and my <Mom> went to the Dresses counter
Workers have put chairs to <Mom> as soon as we go
I now asked to show the new <five> models
Our <Mom> do not like anything in the models they show
She told me to put my favorite <ten> dresses aside
I wore and saw in the trial room whether that <two> was fit for me
Those <two> Dresses  which I chose were fit for me
The cost is too much of the <two> Dresses I selected
Discounts for <two> Dresses in that shopping mall are not even bigger

But my <Mom> is not liking anything and still she is looking
I asked them to show <nine> number Slipper for my legs
As my Slipper size is <nine> therefore they are not able to find more models
The model of Sandals that I like does not have the number <nine>

Meanwhile the <Bus> came we climb calmly and came to home
When I was studying <degree> I used to go <twenty> kilometers on the Bus every day
Sometimes I used to travel in <Auto> as the Buses are not there
I was very afraid to come <home> at night
I use to reach the <home> before it get dark
Our College ends by <four'o clock> itself everyday
My friends used to stay there itself for <N.C.C> classes
By the time they reached home, it was night they came by <Auto>
One day, if I had to come late, I would have come together with <three> of them
But <College> days are so nice never forgotten

In our batch <three> people said they can't Dance as they feel ashamed
But our <Madam> did not agree and said that the whole class should be there
They should Dance like the remaining other <three> girls wearing Pattu Sarees and bursting with Jewelry
Our <Madam> has selected a special gift for us

<Rani's mother> said that let's tell to their Teacher
Their <Mother> also said that <Shravani> is fine
Their <Mothers> searching for them by saying that where they have been playing ?
<Shravani> says to <Rani> let's play some more
No <Rani>, It's evening <Mother> will wait, let's go home
<Shravani> says I still want to play
No <Shravani> let's go home, said <Rani>
<Shravani> says, okay then let's go to home
<Rani> and <Shravani> both left for home
Before this <Shravani> <Rani> mothers saw them
<Rani> <Mother> also scolded <Rani> a lot
Their <Mothers> said that every day you come home late like this
<Rani> cried a lot because of her <Mother's> insulting words
<Shravani> didn't care how much her <Mother> was scolding
However, <Shravani's Mother> started scolding even more
<Shravani> said <Mother>, we are playing from a while
<Shravani's> <Mother> got very angry at <Shravani's> words
<Rani's Mother> says <Rani> will not be allowed to play from tomorrow
<Shravani> says that her <mother> too will not sent her to play from tomorrow
<Shravani> replied that I will play

<Rani> and <Shravani> said their Mothers sent them to play
<Shravani> asked that please send us to play for some time
Their <Mothers> said that no matter what you say, we will not send you to play
<Shravani> and <Rani> cried and said we will come home soon
Their <Mothers> said that, no matter how much you cry, we will not at all send you to play
Their <Mothers> said that from tomorrow you should study diligently in the evening
Their <Mothers> said that we will send you to play only when you study well
<Shravani's Mother> said that,If you go to School and study well, I will send you to play
Well, <Mother> we will study well from tomorrow, said <Rani>
<Shravani> also said that I will study well from tomorrow
Their <Mothers> said, let's go home
<Shravani> <Rani>  reached home cautiously
On waking up in the morning, <Rajesh> <Srinu> came to their house
<Rajesh> asked <Srinu> if we should come out for a swim ?
To that <Rajesh> said to <Srinu> okay, wait for some time
After some time <Srinu> and <Rajesh> went out together
<Rajesh> Mother told him to come home early
<Srinu> and <Rajesh> are going by walking
After traveling for a <hour>, they reached a pond
Many people were there when <Rajesh> and <Srinu> left
Some came there to learn to swim in the <pond>
First <Rajesh> went into the <pond> and saw how deep it was
After that <Rajesh> called <Srinu> to come
<Srinu> does not know how to swim and is very afraid of water
<Rajesh> took <Srinu's> hand and took him into the pond
<Srinu> is slowly learning to swim
As it was already evening, everyone was going from <pond>
<Srinu> also said to <Rajesh> that it is enough for today, let's go
Let's come again tomorrow and swim in the <pond>, said <Srinu>
From there the two walked to <Rajesh's> house
That night the two of them slept in <Rajesh's> house
Let's go to the <pond> again in the morning, asked <Srinu>
<Rajesh> says no, he has to go to College today
<Srinu> I will come too, he said I have some work in the city
But <Rajesh> said let's both go
<Srinu> he said that I will take the cart and let us both go
<Srinu> <Rajesh> together they went to a nearby city on a cart
Leaving <Rajesh> at the College, <Srinu> went out
When <Rajesh> went to the class, many greeted <Rajesh>
<Rajesh> said hi to everyone and sat on his bench
The <History> teacher came into the class and started the class
It was the <first> day of College so the <History> teacher asked everyone's names
After telling the names of everyone in the class, he started the <History> class
He said the <History> class was nearly of <three> hours
After the <History> class we all went out
<Rajesh> asked if <Mallesh> would like to drink cool drinks ?
<Rajesh>, he says I can't drink, you drink
But <Mallesh> asked if he would like to eat <Samosa>, he said okay
He said okay <Rajesh>, I will eat it after a while
<Mallesh> asked <Rajesh> that what would be the next class ?
<Rajesh> says I don't even know if there will be a <English> class or not
Well, whatever class it is, let's listen, said <Mallesh>
<Mallesh> and <Rajesh> went to the class together
After going to the class, the <Telugu> teacher came shortly
The teacher gave a <Telugu> lesson and went out
After lunch break, <twenty> people went out
Both <Malesh> and <Rajesh> went to the canteen together
<Rajesh> took two <Samosas> in the canteen
<Mallesh> gave the canteen bill <thirty> rupees
In our final year of College we had to submit <three> records
Also <two> practical exams were also conducted and viva was also asked
First of all, <Divya> was called to ask about Viva and she went as soon as she was called
<Sir> checked the entire record and started asking questions to <Divya>
When the first question was asked, <Divya> did not know the answer
Not knowing the answer to the question asked by <Sir>, <Divya> started looking here and there
<Sir> noticed that <Divya> did not know the answer
Not answering that question, <Sir> asked another question
<Divya> answered this question but only partially
<Sir> understood that <Divya> did not read
<Sir> angrily gave the record to <Divya> and told her to go and study
<Divya> silently took the book and sat down
Later <sir> called <Priyanka>
My friend <Priyanka> get up and went near <Sir>
<Sir> started asking questions from her too
<Priyanka> answered all the questions asked by <sir> fastly
<Sir> has also corrected the <Priyanka> record
<Sir> appreciated <Priyanka> for answering all the questions asked by him
And then it was my turn <sir> called my name
As soon as I left, <sir> started asking questions
At first I didn't really know the answers to the <two> questions
While <Sir> is asking questions, I answered only what I knew
<Sir> also corrected my record and gave it to me and asked me to go and sit
I was very scared but <sir> sent me without any thought
Also the remaining <ten> boys were also asked viva questions one by one
As soon as the <three> practical exams are over, we will start the final exams
My friend <Divya> <Priyanka> decided to study very well
While watching, hall tickets were also received for <twenty> people and we went and got them
When they came to know that hall tickets were being given in the Office room, <twenty> people went at once
Before taking the hall ticket we will check whether we have paid the fee amount of <ten> thousands
A huge queue of <hundred> people was seen near the hall ticket taking place
But somehow I got hall ticket for our <three> friends
If we look, there are only <three> days left for the exams
My friends <Priyanka> <Divya> started reading well
I also saw them and started reading for <two> hours
There are <three> days for the exams and the syllabus to read is huge
If I fell asleep in the middle of studying for an <hour>, I fell asleep
In the middle, I suddenly remembered the exams and woke up at <ten o'clock>
I drank some <Tea> and started reading again
After studying for <three> hours, the entire syllabus was over
We all went to the examination center in a <Van>
By the time we got there in the <Van>, everyone was already there
The <three> of us went early and found our rooms in our exam hall
<Hundred> people are preparing very hastily
We <three> also found a good place to sit and revise
In <ten> minutes the bell rang saying it was time for the exam
On hearing bell sound, <hundred> people ran into the examination center
All <three> of us immediately went into the exam room
The test will be held in separate rooms for <three> of us
I went to find my <ten> number and sat in my place
<Twenty> people started coming into the room one by one
When everyone came, the <invigilator sir> also brought the question paper
When the long bell rang, everyone was given question papers by <Sir>
I am very tensed about how the <Telugu> paper will come
As soon as the <Telugu> paper was given, I read the whole once
After seeing the <Telugu> question paper, my mind was a bit relaxed
<Ten> questions came from what I had read and I got courage
And I boldly started writing answers of <ten> questions
So after <three> hours our test was over
When the long bell rang, <hundred> people came out
My friends <Divya> <Priyanka> faces also light up with smiles
When I came out, I asked <Divya> <Priyanka> how they written the exam ?
<Divya> <Priyanka> happily said it was written very well
After the exam we all went to the <bus stop>
After going to the <bus stop>, <Priyanka> asked <Divya> what she would do next  ?
<Priyanka> told <Divya> that I want to do P.G
Priyanka asked <Divya> what will you do <Divya> ?
<Divya> replied that I want to be a <Police>
And <Divya> <Priyanka> asked me together what will you be ?
I answered that I wanted to be a <collector>
Hearing my answer, <Divya> was suddenly shocked
Meanwhile, while talking like that, the <Bus> that we had to board came
The whole <Bus> was empty and we all sat down quickly
Today we found the whole <Bus> empty as we used to fight for a seat next to the window
I and <Divya> are sitting at the window seat and sleeping peacefully
Before I could close my eyes and open them, the stop where <Divya> had to get off came first
<Divya> got off the <Bus> saying bye to all of us and left
At the next stop, <Priyanka> also got down and left
At last my town came and I also got off the <Bus> and came home
When I came home, my <Mother> asked me how I wrote the exam ?
I said very well written Mother and my <Mother> was very happy
My <Mother> brought hot <Maggi> for me
I was very hungry and ate <Maggi> fastly
After eating <Maggi>, I slept peacefully for a while
When I woke up at <three o'clock>, I remembered that there was an exam the next day
Even all our exams are over within <ten> days
As soon as the exams were over, all our friends went to the <beach> together
Everyone was sad because it was the last day of our <Degree>
We spent <three> hours time taking photos
There is a lot of pain in the mind of <Divya> who is smiling upwards
I was afraid that I would never meet <Degree> friends again
My friends <Divya> <Priyanka> keep calling me forever
As soon as the <Degree> was over, everyone joined different courses
One day I unexpectedly had to go to another town <Miryalaguda>
That day I was going with my <sister> <Anusha>
Meanwhile, I noticed one thing while riding the <Auto>
<Mango> plantation is done free of cost in our village
I love <Mango> plants very much
They are bringing and distributing <Mango> Plants in a Tractor
A bag of fertilizer is also given along with the <Mango> Plants
Everyone is going and taking Plants but I am in the <Auto>
I had to go urgent <Miryalaguda> so there was no chance of taking the Plants
Well, I called to tell my <Mother> about the matter
But my <Mother> was also at work and did not check the phone
Everyone took <Mango> Plants but we only didn't take
Since then I have decided to buy <Mango> Plants
<The day before> I went out to write an exam and saw a nursery
The nursery has <twenty> varieties of new Plants
The entire nursery was filled with beautiful <red> flowers
Apart from the <Mango> Plants, there are many other types of Plants
First I selected all the <Mango> Plants I wanted
My <Father> asked us to take some other Plants along with the <Mango> Plants
And while looking, there were also seen <Betel Trees>
I asked my <father> to take a <Betel Leaf> Tree too
My <father> told me to take all the plants that I like
Many kinds of <Rose> plants were also seen there
I love the transplanted variety of <Roses> very much
While searching for them, small <Chrysanthemum> was also found there
It is said that <Jasmine> vines are also there
My <Father> buys me what I like, so I am taking whatever I like
While walking around the whole nursery, I also saw an <Amla> Tree
I also took one of the <Amla> Tree as <Amla> is said to be very good for health
I also took pictures with <three> nice Plants saying that it was very beautiful to see there
Apart from the Plants that grow on the ground, there are also <three> types of hanging Plants in pot
Last time I saw such Plants near our <Aunt's> house
When we asked our <Aunt>, she said that she got it from the nursery
I wanted to stay in that nursery for <two> hours
In total I picked some <Mango> Plants as well as some <Roses>
I also took my favorite <Betel Leaf> tree and <Amla> Trees
I also took pots to put <Rose> Plants in that nursery
He said that there is also a bag of <five kg> fertilizer for the nursery people to put on the Plants
We also took <one> bag of fertilizer for the Plants
We carefully brought home the <six> Plants
When we brought it home, we sprinkled some Water on the <six> Plants
My <Father> made the pots for the Plants and prepared the soil for them
At <five o'clock> that evening we potted the Plants
Any Plants that is planted by my <Sister> or my <Father> will survive
My desire to Plant <Mango> was fulfilled
My < Father> entrusted me with the responsibility of watering and fertilizing all those Plants
I used to look at the Plants when I woke up at <four o'clock> in the morning
I sprinkled <three> jugs of water twice in the early evening
I used to fertilize the Plants at least once in <two> days
I used to take care in every <two> days to prevent any weeds from growing in the pots
Now those <six> Plants are very healthy and beautiful
<Rose> Plants are also producing colorful Flowers
Above all, <little Rose> is very beautiful in it
But my <Mother> used to pluck Flowers for the neighbours
I told my <Mother> that I don't like plucking flowers
My <Mother> love to reap them only for our God
During the day, my <Mother> used to pluck Flowers and put them near God
So I and my <Mother> filled our whole house with <Flowers>
My <Sister> always asks my <Mother> to buy straps
My <Father> also kept telling my <Mother> to buy straps to my <Sister>
My <Mother> said she would buy it and kept forgetting
My <Sister> took my <Mother> to the shop to buy some straps
My <Mother> my <Sister> went to shop and found out the price of <Silver>
The shopkeeper said that the <Silver> rate was too high
But my <Sister> fussed that I just wanted straps
My <Mother> said okay that she can buy it
My <Sister> happily asked the shopkeeper to show them the model
The shopkeeper is showing the new <ten> models
She puts aside all the models that our <Sister> likes
My <Mother> also selected a model for me without telling me
When our <Sister> finished selecting, the bill was drawn
I don't know that my <Mother> had bought me a pair of straps too
They paid the bill for both and came home quickly
My <Mother> took out the straps she had bought for me and called me
I was also very happy when my <Mother> brought the straps
For the first time my <Mother> brought me straps without asking me anything
<Mother> immediately put the straps on my legs and felt happy to see me
My <Sister> was also very happy walking around the house with the leash on
Since then, the bracelets that my <Mother> bought for me makes me very sentimental
Our neighbour <Saroj> Aunty saw and asked that where she bought the straps?
My <Mother> told all the details to <Saroj> aunty
<Saroj> Aunty also wanted to get similar straps for their daughter
<Saroj> Aunty asked my <Mother> too let's go and buy the straps
<Saroj> Aunty's daughter also went and bought straps like me with my <Mother>.
Our <Mother> selection is always best
Today morning in my home my <Mother> asked my <Sister> which tiffin you want ?
My <Sister> doesn't really like <Upma>
But I like very much the <Upma> prepared by <Mother>
My <Sister> asked my <Mother> to make <Dosa>
But my <Mother> said <Dosa> flour is not there and asked me to tell something else
My <Sister> is thinking what she actually wants
In the meantime my <Mother> asked me what you want ?
I told to <Mother> that I like<Upma> prepared by you
But my <Sister> immediately say I don't want to eat <Upma>
Immediately our <Mother> shouted on her and said you should be silent
But my <Sister> made hankering I want <Idli>
My <Mother> shouted to my <Sister> to hear what she said
Saying okay, my <Mother> brought <Idli> from outside for my <sister>
My <Mother> made  <Upma> for me and my <Father> at our house only
My <Sister> always fight like this at our home
After bringing <Idli> I want <Upma> and ate <Upma> only
Like this, my <Sister> keeps quarreling about everything in the house
Both <Teja> and <Chandrika> who are behind our house are going for a walk together in the morning
<Teja> and <Chandrika> both came to me and asked that you also come for walking Sister
Well let's go for <walking> I told them
You have to get up early in the morning to go for a <walking>
We agreed to wake each other up every <three> hours a day
On the first day, I called <Teja> <Chandrika> and woke up
On the first day, after waking up early in the morning, we brushed up and went for <walking>
Walking like that we went a little distance and went inside the <ground>
<Ground> is very peaceful and quiet
We were walking for <three> kilometers calmly listening to songs
The man who works there on the <ground> also keep lights for us early in the morning
After <walking> around for a while, we all got sweaty
We all did exercises in the <ground> for some time
After <two> hours we have returned to home
By the time we got home it was dawn and my <Mother> <Father> had woken up
My <Mother> made <Green Tea> for me as soon as I got home
I drank <Green Tea> and slept peacefully for a while
Similarly, my <Mother> said that going for <Walking> every day is good for health
The next day <Teja's> turn came and <Teja> called early in the morning
But today it is very cold, so we went wearing <Sweater>
As we were walking, we saw a <Tea> shop
Soon we all drank <Tea> and felt very comfortable
As soon as we drank <Tea> we started walking fast as if we got new enthusiasm
After that, we went to the <Ground> and did three rounds and left
Everyone says that doing this kind of <Walking> is very good for health
This year we celebrated <Sankranti> very well

There were two Mothers named <Sitamma> and <Ramalakshmi>
<Sitamma> used to get up everyday and sweep the house well
<Ramalakshmi> see <Sitamma> and start sweeping the house
The rivalry between <Sitammaku> and <Ramalakshmi> was competition
Every morning <Sitamma> used to make good Rangolis
<Rama Lakshmi> also used to make good Rangoli every day
<Rama Lakshmi> used to bath and worship the god immediately after making the Rangoli
<Sitamma> also worshiped to God very nicely
<Sitamma> and <Ramalakshmi> both went to the Flower garden to pick Flowers
<Seethamma> thought that more Flowers would be picked by <Rama Lakshmi>
Where <Ramalakshmi> picks more Flowers, <Seethamma> also picks more Flowers
<Rama Lakshmi> carried Flowers to decorate the deity
<Seethamma> also worshiped the God after adorning it well
<Rama Lakshmi> performed puja and distributed prasadam to everyone
<Seethamma> saw that <Rama Lakshmi> was doing puja and distributing prasad to everyone

<Sitamma> said I will go to the Temple and come quickly
Okay <mother>, I will take care of the house, said lady standing opposite
<Ramalakshmi> quickly went to the Temple without locking the door of the house
When <Sitamma> went to the Temple she saw that <Rama Lakshmi> had finished the puja
But, <Seetamma> thought, let's do the pooja slowly and then go
<Rama Lakshmi> wanted to do pooja quickly and go home
From the Temple <Rama Lakshmi> left for home
<Ramalakshmi> reached home walking slowly
<Sitamma> just slowly worships in the Temple without hurrying
After performing the puja, <Sitamma> sat in the Temple for some time
<Sitamma> sat reading some of the books there

<Seethamma> told the <Priest> that she will leave for the house
The Priest said <Sitamma> go and come carefully
<Sitamma> came out of the Temple and left for home
<Seethamma> gave charity to some people on the way
<Sitamma> started walking slowly and left for home
After distributing prasadam to <ten> people there, she went home
On the street everyone asked <Sithamma> if she had gone back and come again to the Temple ?
No one in this street asked <Ramalakshmi> if she had gone to the Temple or not ?
<Ramalakshmi> said that no one asked me whether I had been gone and came back to the Temple
She said that on the street I did not see <RamaLakshmi> going to the Temple
<Sitamma> smiled and distributed prasad to everyone
<Ten> people took Prasadam and they were happy
Everyday in that street all praise <Seethamma>
<Rama Lakshmi> keep thinking on the street that I should speak well
<Sitamma> thinks that she will do all things very well
